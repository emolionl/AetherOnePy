    "Characteristics" : [ "The few symptoms of the Schema were provided by Paine (eclectic), whom Hale quotes. Paine used Pop. t. in affections of the bladder, urethra, and prostate. Hale confirms its action in vesical tenesmus and inflammation of the neck of the bladder. He gives this case: A lady had metritis, vaginismus, and cystitis, and was apparently cured. A ride on the cars brought back: Weight, pressure, and aching in pelvis and vesical tenesmus with frequent desire to urinate. Pop. p. 3x removed all these symptoms in three days. In the cases cured by Hale he says there was little pain during urination, but as soon as the last drops were voided, or a little before, a severe cramp-like pain just behind pubes lasting ten to fifteen minutes." ],
