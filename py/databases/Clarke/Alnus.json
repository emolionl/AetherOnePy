The plant grows in swamps and marshes. Among its indications are: Leucorrhoea with erosions which bleed easily; amenorrhoea with burning pains from back to pubis. Haematuria. Cooper, who has used a fresh plant tincture of A. glutinosa, gives: \"Pain in rectum after stool\"; and \"heaviness in head as after being drunk the night before\" as having been produced by it. Hale gives as particularly indicating it: \"Eruptions on the skin alternating with diseased conditions of mucous membrane.\"" ],
