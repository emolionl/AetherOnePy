    "Clinical" : [ "Ague. Aphthae. Gravel. Neurasthenia." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "E. aromat., when chewed, produces in the mouth a warm, aromatic, pungent sensation, and is regarded as a \"warm, stimulating tonic.\" Hale quotes eclectic authorities as commending this plant in \"aphthous stomatitis\" in women and children; also for burning in the stomach with \"nursing sore mouth, \", before and after confinement. Some commend it as a \"nervine, \", like Scutellaria and Cypripedium for \"restlessness and morbid watchfulness, morbid irritability of the nervous system, tremors, jactitations, chorea, and hysteria.\" It is doubly indicated where nervous erethism and aphthous disease are combined. Locally it is useful as a wash for the mouth. Like E. purpur. it has also been used for gravel.; and the Indians use it as a cure for ague. In a case of sore mouth in a man, recorded by P. S. Duff, Eup. aromat. O caused soon \"a general aggravation, like a cold or catarrh; annoyed by pain in left shoulder, posterior scapular region; pulse unnatural; tight in left bronchia; felt ill, dull, and oppressed.\" (H. R., xi. 129.)" ]
