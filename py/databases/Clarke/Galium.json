    "Characteristics" : [ "Galium has had no proving, but it is a popular remedy for cancer given internally and used externally; and also for scrofulous swellings and ulcers. It is further used as a diuretic and as a solvent for gravel and stone. It has cured a case of nodulated tumour of the tongue diagnosed to be cancer (see Hale); and a case of psoriasis of the hand (left) has been reported cured. Substantial doses were given in each case, and in the latter poultices of the herb were used as well." ]
