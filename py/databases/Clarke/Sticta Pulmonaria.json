    "Characteristics" : [ "There cannot be much doubt whence Sticta received its name of Pulmonaria. The likeness of the plant to lung tissue is self-evident. It was a popular remedy of great repute in catarrhs and coughs when Hale introduced it to homeopathy. S. P. Burdock, C. H. Lutes, and S. Lilienthal proved it and elicited some very remarkable and valuable symptoms. Hering added many no less valuable clinical symptoms. Dewey (Trans. Paris Int. H. Cong. p. 317) conducted another proving on several persons which has further enriched the pathogenesis. His additions are marked (D) in the Schema. \"It was first used, \", says Hale, \"for severe, harassing cough, \", and such good results accrued that provings were made to ascertain its full value. It was found to cause severe coryza, with violent sneezing, intense headache, and conjunctivitis. These attacks were preceded or followed by rheumatic pains and swelling of the small joints.\" The catarrh of Stic. is for the most part obstructive; and if there is discharge it dries quickly, and forms crusts or scurf. Constant need to blow the nose, but no discharge comes on account of dryness. In syphilis, or any other disease where this condition is present, Stic. will be the remedy. A grand characteristic both of headaches and catarrh is a \"dull, heavy pressure (or stuffed feeling) in root of nose.\" The cough of Stic. is also dry. \"Dry night cough\" is a keynote: cough dry, < evening and night; can neither sleep nor lie down; must sit up. P. C. Majumdar (Ind. H. R., v. 109) cured two cases of whooping-cough with Stic. 6x. The cough began just after sunset, and went on till vomiting occurred, and all the contents of the stomach were thrown off. Stic. will often cure coughs left by measles, whooping-cough, influenza. Hard, dry barking coughs following colds. In cases of phthisis and haemoptysis it is of great service. \"Oppression at chest; sensation as if a hard mass on it. Sudden pain from sternum to spine, constant, <, on movement, \", are leading symptoms in such cases, in addition to those of the cough. Phthisis and rheumatism not infrequently occur in different members of a phthisical family; and rheumatism (as the word implies) is related to catarrh. Stic. meets all these conditions; and it has, like Bacil., \"a deep-in headache.\" Elias C. Price (in Southern J. of H.) relates this case: Boy, had acute rheumatism with inflammation and redness of one knee, ankle, toes, wrist, and fingers; valvular heart disease from a previous attack. Aco. and Sul. failed to relieve. Stic. 1x was given every hour. Next day there was a considerable quantity of fluid in the knee-joint [an aggravation by Stic. apparently], but otherwise the boy was better. Stic. was continued. Next day half the fluid was gone, and the third day it was all gone and the boy was cured in nine days. Price remarks that he had noticed one symptom so frequently present in the cases he cured with Stic. that he began to regard it as a characteristic although it was not in the provings: A spot of inflammation and redness on the affected joint like the hectic flush on the cheeks in phthisis. In housemaid's-knee Stic. comes as near being a specific as a remedy ever can. M. D. Youngman (H. M., p. 360) related a number of cases of catarrhal and pulmonary affections cured with Stic. O, the indications being: Harsh, racking, incessant, \"unprofitable cough of spasmodic type. He considers it especially Suited to neuralgic, rheumatic, gouty individuals. Here is one of his cases: Mrs. H., had an attack of bronchitis in January, and when seen, March 29th, had a harsh, racking cough, with pain all through chest on coughing; spongy state of mucous membrane of pharynx, which bleeds easily; has had several attacks of asthma; has hay-fever every August; paroxysms of cough often end in convulsive sneezing, which she dreads because it is followed by asthmatic symptoms. \"She takes cold in her head, which in a day or so goes down in her throat, and thence into her chest.\" Every cold she gets does this. Stic. 1x gave relief in five days. Hale says Stic. is indispensable in February, March, and April in the American climate. L. O. Rogers (S. J. of H.) prescribed Stic. for a patient with the cough of the remedy at the time she was nursing her seventh child. She had always been annoyed because of a scantiness of milk; it had been occasionally entirely suppressed. Whilst taking Stic. the flow became ample, and remained so as long as an occasional dose was being taken. Rogers subsequently verified this effect in a number of cases. Another use of Stic. is in sleeplessness, which is due to nervousness, or to cough. This is part of its action on the nervous system. Stic. is one of the remedies which produce the levitation symptom: the legs feel as if floating in the air; head as if floating off; as if the body and limbs did not touch the bed. Hysterical chorea coming on after profuse haemorrhage has been cured by Stic. Peculiar Sensations are: As if she cannot keep her tongue still. As if stomach full of yeast. Throat and mouth burn as if scalded. As if hard mass collected in lungs. As if floating in air. The right side is more prominently affected. The symptoms are: < By touch. < Motion (also: must get up and move about for relief from pain of knee). < Turning eyes. Pressure >. Lying down > headache; < cough. Influenza is > in open air. Many symptoms are < as the day advances, lasting all day. Cough < nights (comparatively free from it during day). Coughing < cough (the more he coughs, the more he wants to)." ],
