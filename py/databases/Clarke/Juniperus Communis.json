Gin owes its distinctive properties to the oil of juniper berries, and that is why this spirit is in such popular repute as a remedy for dysmenorrhoea. It has a very powerful action on the kidneys, and has cured cases of renal dropsy. Hale also commends it in certain coughs with scanty, loaded urine. He says German doctors use Juniper much in gastric affections, abdominal flatulence and colic." ],
