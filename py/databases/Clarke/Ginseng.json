    "Characteristics" : [ "The symptoms of the Chinese and the American Ginseng are taken together, as the two are probably identical. The name is said to signify \"the resemblance of a man\" or man's thigh. The root is forked like that of the mandrake. Fabulous prices are given for it in Manchuria, as much as Â£40 per pound being paid for certain qualities of it. The wild Ginseng of Siberia is said to be the best. The natives along the Ussuri river use it boiled for headaches, colds, fevers, stomach pains. In America it is a domestic remedy for the after-pains of labour. The shape of the root might indicate an action on the pelvis and lower limbs, and J. H. Henry (H. R., xi. 493) says it acts on the lower part of the spinal marrow; is indicated by \"bruised pains in small of back and thighs (on rising from bed), and great languor, with paralytic, rheumatic pains in lower limbs, arthritic swelling of the foot, which had been exerted a long time, violent pain in big toe.\" He mentions also \"Nightly digging in right lower limb from hip to big toe, cramp, pains from right hip to toes; lancinating, tearing in right tarsal joint.\" He considers it specific in lumbago, sciatica and chronic rheumatism, with frequent desire to urinate, and sexual excitement. Lembke and others have proved it. It is an aromatic stimulant and removes feelings of fatigue, imparting a joyous sense of vigour and elasticity to the limbs, especially the upper limbs, and clearness of mind. The opposite condition of malaise is also produced. Yawning, and drowsiness. Drowsiness with headache. Feeling of extreme heat and intense coldness, longing to expose the body to cool air. The right side of the body is most affected. There is pain in right side. of hypogastrium, extending into groin. Dry mouth, tongue, and lips. Vertigo. The respiratory organs are affected as with Aralia racem. Mouth and throat are sensitive to the ordinary air of room; are < in free open air and from talking, > at dinner. Many symptoms are < in open air; at night bending or turning; descending stairs; sitting." ],
