    "Characteristics" : [ "Peruvian Balsam has been chiefly used empirically in catarrhal phthisis or bronchial catarrh with copious purulent expectoration. Sputa thick, creamy, yellowish white; loud rales, night sweats, hectic. Hale has used it with success in \"chronic, purulent, fetid anterior or posterior nasal catarrh, with or without ulceration.\" He says that a cerate of the Balsam is the best application next to Glycerole of Aloes for indolent ulcers, cracked nipples, cracks in fingers and palmer surfaces of hands, or fissured and chapped lips. The Balsam is also used externally for killing the acarus of itch. All parts affected are gently rubbed with it at night and a bath taken in the morning. A single application is sufficient. It has been proved by Lembke." ],
