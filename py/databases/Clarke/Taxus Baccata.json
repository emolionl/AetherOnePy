    "Characteristics" : [ "The poisonous properties of the Yew have been recognised and disputed from ancient times. Gerarde says that in his schooldays he and his companions ate their fill of the berries of the Yew and slept not only under its shade, but on its branches, without any ill effect. But there is plenty of evidence on the other side. Recently (Med. Press, May 1901), a patient of Mullingar Asylum died suddenly from eating Yew leaves. Some years ago a correspondence in the Times brought to light instances of the lethal effects of Yew leaves on cattle. One correspondent, Mr. James Simmons, of Haslemere, mentions an observation made by himself and others, that Yew leaves are more poisonous some time after they have been cut than when fresh: \"Yew cropped green from the tree has no fatal effect, \", and animals do not eat it fresh, they prefer grass; but if Yew has been cut and allowed to wither cattle will eat it in large quantities, and in that state it is deadly poison.\" \"My people, \", says Mr. Simmons, \"once buried some Yew cuttings deep in the dung of a farmyard; a number of large hogs dug it up, ate it, and all died.\"", "The symptoms of the pathogenesis are made up of poisonings by leaves and berries, and also of provings by Gastier. Fainting is a very prominent feature with Tax., and the fatal cases end in convulsions, collapse, and syncope. Death from Yew poisoning, says Cooper, is remarkably painless. \"Empty feeling\" in the stomach was prominent; and it was noted that the digestion was very rapid. \"Must eat frequently\" is a characteristic. Gastric catarrh is set up with vomiting of tenacious mucus. The saliva is increased, and it also is viscid; and there is viscid sweat. An intense action on the skin was developed, and Tax. is indicated in pustular skin affections, the pustules being large, flat, and strongly itching. On the suggestion of Cooper, I once gave a single dose of Tax. O in a case of aural polypus (bright red) with catarrh, in a youth, with the result that the polypus shrivelled up to one-third of its former size. The shooting pains in the toes suggest the use of Tax. in gout. The kidneys and bladder were much irritated; and the heart disturbed. Tax. has been recommended as a substitute for Dig., being considered superior to the latter in having no cumulative effect. The symptoms were < by pressure. Rubbing > itching of eyelids. Coughing = headache. Deep respiration = cough. < Before and after each meal. < By application of liquids. < After coitus." ],
