    "Characteristics" : [ "Cadmium is found in nature in intimate association with Zinc, which it nearly resembles in action, but Cadmium acts more powerfully. The profound action of Cad. s. on the stomach", "burning and cutting pain, intense retching, gagging, bringing up tough mucus, intense nausea and vomiting", "led to its being given in yellow fever with brilliant success. Black vomit is very characteristic. The least thing touching the lips will excite vomiting. Pitchy taste; food tastes like salt. Cadm. is a cross between Bry. and Ars.: it has the desire to keep quiet of Bry., with the exhaustion and stomach irritability of Ars. (Kent). Cadmium is a chilly medicine. There is icy coldness", "coldness even when near a fire. Horripilation: after drinking; with hot hands. Sweat in axillae. Effect of a draught of cold air in checking sweat. < From cold air; itching of skin when cold. < Sunshine. < In morning and after sleep. < Walking; < ascending stairs. < When swallowing. < After grief. < After intoxication. > By eating.
