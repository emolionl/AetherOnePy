    "Characteristics" : [ "A decoction of the viscous inner bark of Ul. ful. is much used as a poultice for lessening pain in inflammations. In a case in which the mucous membrane of the rectum was dry and extremely painful, Burnett relieved the sufferings with 20-drop doses of the tincture. The bark in trituration gives much relief as a snuff in old vascular deafness with tubal obstruction (Cooper)." ]
