    "Clinical" : [ "Fibroma. Menorrhagia. Metrorrhagia." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "This is one of Dr. Burnett's nosodes, used by him in cases of haemorrhage and obtained, as I conclude, from a case of haemorrhage in a patient suffering from fibrous tumour, possibly with malignant elements. At any rate, I have found it of great value in controlling uterine haemorrhage, whether connected with fibrous growth or not. I have used it in the 30th upwards, giving one or two doses weekly." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Compare: The cancer nosodes; in fibrous tumours and uterine haemorrhages, Thlaspi b. p., Fraxin., Hydrastis and its alkaloids." ]
