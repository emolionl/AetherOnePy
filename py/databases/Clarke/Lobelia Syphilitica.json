    "Clinical" : [ "Acidity. Adenoids. Asthma. Back, pains in. Borborygmi. Cartilages, pains in. Catarrh. Coryza. Cough. Dyspepsia. Eustachian catarrh. Flatulence. Hay-fever. Influenza. Kidneys, pains in. Lumbago. Melancholia. Post-nasal catarrh. Pylorus, pain in. Sciatica. Spine, pains in. Spleen, affections of. Stomach cough. Throat, sore." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "The symptoms of the Lob. syph. proving, whilst in many points analogous to those of the other Lobelias, do not bring out the emetic properties of Lob. inflata. There is, however, epigastric sinking, flatulence, dyspepsia, and diarrhoea. Lob. card., Lob. inf., and Lob. syph. all have a milky juice. Hale quotes Rafinesque as saying that the analysis of Lob. syph. shows it to contain Silex, Iron, and Muriate and Phosphate of Lime. The marked action of Lob. syph. on the posterior nares led Cooper to use it with success in cases of deafness arising from an \"unhealthy, soft, swollen, easily bleeding catarrhal\" condition of the naso-pharynx. This is emphasised by another symptom: \"Dull aching pain in centre of forehead, over root of nose.\" Cooper (who uses an acetic preparation) considers that with this, as well as with the Inflata, a history of suppression is a leading indication. There are many notable symptoms in the back, back of chest, and about the lower ribs. Some of these led Jeanes (the first prover) to make a very fine cure of melancholia in an educated, intelligent man, of which these were the characteristics: \"Great depression of spirits; unhappy state of mind, always associated with pain about and under short ribs in back on left side, extending outward nearly to left side posterior aspect of region of spleen.\" In the proving there was this: Pain on inside of right scapula. Farrington adds this: \"Pain under (not below) inner border of left scapula, < after weeping.\" The pains of Lob. syph. travel about, from right to left; from left tonsil to right; from back down legs; from eighth rib downward; aching from back of head down nape. Then there are frequent synalgias: Pain in right maxillary joint, with pain in middle of right lung; pain in breast and larynx; pain in left side of chest near axilla, with aching in left shoulder and arm. Touch < (soreness of ischium). Motion <. Deep inspiration <. Drinking cold water > (temporarily) gastric symptoms. Mental exertion < (mental state). Reading and writing < pain in forehead. Internal nose painfully sensitive to cool air. Inhaling moderately cool air <. Flushing after dinner > somewhat in open air. Symptoms < after dinner. < At night. Secretion of thick mucus > throat soreness." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Compare: Other Lobelias; Puls. (mental depression and weeping); Chel. and Ranunc. (scapular pains); Hydrast. (postnasal catarrh); Cean. (spleen).
