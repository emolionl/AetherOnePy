    "Characteristics" : [ "\"The first trituration and first dilution in alcohol of the snake-poison Trigonocephalus lachesis was made by Hering on July The first cases were published in the Archives in In this remedy was introduced into our materia medica.\" I quote from Hering's Guiding Symptoms, vol. vi., of which Lach. occupies nearly one hundred pages, and comprises the substance of a monograph he was compiling at the time of his death to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the introduction of the remedy into the materia medica. To the genius and the heroism of Hering the world owes this remedy and many another of which this has been the forerunner. When Hering's first experiments were made he was botanising and zoologising on the Upper Amazon for the German Government. Except his wife, all those about him were natives, who told him so much about the dreaded Surukuku that he offered a good reward for a live specimen. At last one was brought in a bamboo box, and those who brought it immediately fled, and all his native servants with them. Hering stunned the snake with a blow on the head as the box opened, then, holding its head in a forked stick, he pressed its venom out of the poison bag upon sugar of milk. The effect of handling the virus and preparing the lower attenuations was to throw Hering into a fever with tossing delirium and mania", "much to his wife's dismay. Towards morning he slept, and on waking his mind was clear. He drank a little water to moisten his throat, and the first question this indomitable prover asked was: \"What did I do and say?\" His wife remembered vividly enough. The symptoms were written down, and this was the first instalment of the proving of Lachesis. The natives crept back one by one next day, and were astonished to find Hering and his wife alive. The snake grows to seven feet and upwards in length, has fangs nearly an inch long, a reddish brown skin marked along the back with blackish brown rhomboidal spots. Nearly all the provings of Lachesis were made with the 30th and higher attenuations.", "The four grand characteristics of Lach. are: (1) < By sleep. (2) Excessive sensitiveness of the surface with intolerance of touch or constriction. (3) Left-sidedness, and the direction left to right: symptoms begin on the left side and either remain there or proceed to the right. (4) > From the onset of a discharge. There is headache > as soon as nasal catarrh comes on. Uterine pains > as soon as menses appear. The other side of this is < from non-appearance of an expected discharge, and it is this which is the foundation of the appropriateness of Lach. to the climacteric state. Wherever one or more of these features is prominent in any case Lach. will most likely prove the remedy. Homoeopathic literature abounds with illustrations of the first named", "< from sleep. I will take an illustration from Nash: An old syphilitic suffered from obstinate constipation, and was taken with severe attacks of colic. The pains seemed to extend all through the abdomen, and always came on at night. The man was not making any progress, when one day he remarked to Nash, \"Doctor, if I could only keep awake I would never have another attack.\" And in response to an inquiring look from the doctor, he added, \"I mean that I sleep into the attack and waken in it.\" He never had another. One dose of Lach. cured the colic and the constipation too. \"Sleeps into an aggravation;\" \"< after sleep whether by day or by night;\" \"as soon as he falls asleep the breathing stops \"", "there are endless varieties of forms in which this peculiarity may be met with. < By closing the eyes (vertigo) is allied to this. But the presence of the opposite condition > after sleep) does not necessarily contraindicate Lach. Rushmore (H. P., xii. 64) cured with Lach. c.m. a married woman who had been a great sufferer from headache, which always began with dim and aching eyes. The pain was of sharp, neuralgic character, in temples and eyes, < right side. If she could not be still with it she had nausea and very bitter vomiting. Sometimes unable to be still a minute, at others could not stir. Brought on by least fatigue. Keeps her in bed all day, and one attack is scarcely over before another comes on. Mental excitement, as receiving a call; induces it. With the headaches she is very cold; and with and after them has a very bitter mouth. Wants to close the eyes with the headache, which is > by sleep. Smarting in eyeballs and dim vision for several days after headache. During the headache much heart trouble; after the headache \"skipping beats, \", soreness about head, pain in side. Loss of appetite after headache. Menses regular, painless, too free. Leucorrhoea many ears. A single dose of Lach. was given at the time, and the severe headache left on the way home. A constant light headache, with heaviness of head in morning, remained some days; but, without repetition, the remedy completely cured the headaches and the heart trouble as well. The haemorrhages of Lach. have this peculiarity", "they contain flakes of decomposed blood looking like charred wheat straw. Uterine haemorrhage and haemorrhages in typhoid fever presenting these characters will find their remedy in Lach. The sensitiveness to contact of Lach. is not so much on account of pain or aggravation of pain as on account of the uneasiness it causes. In uterine affections the patient wants to lift the clothes up to prevent contact with lower abdomen. Touching the throat in laryngeal affections causes suffocative spasms. A minor characteristic of Lach. is pain in the shin bones. \"Much pain in shin bones of an aching kind only.\" This has been frequently verified, but W. J. Guernsey (H. P., x. 476) has pointed out Rat when such pains occur concomitantly with throat affections, Lach. is specific. This I have confirmed. Guernsey remarks that in such cases it will always be found that the throat affection is < on left side or commenced on left side. According to Hering, Lach. is particularly suitable to those of melancholic disposition (Such provers showed most symptoms); next, to choleric individuals. Phlegmatic and lymphatic persons are also suitable, but principally when their dispositions border on the melancholic, with dark eyes and tendency to laziness and sadness. Lach. does not suit sanguine persons with high colour, fine, delicate skins, and impressible natures, unless the disease should have imparted to their disposition a choleric or melancholy tinge. Lach. especially suits choleric women with freckles and red hair. To this list must be added: Persons who have peculiar sensitiveness of the surface of the body. Women who \"have never been well since the change of life.\" Debilitated, weakened persons. Thin rather than fat persons; persons who have been changed both mentally and physically by their illness. Drunkards. Sufferers from effect of masturbation. Persons who have been overdosed with Mercury; and to syphilitic, mercurial affections. Children and old people. Persons who cannot stand the sun and who are < in summer weather. A patient of mine, a tall, broad-shouldered, very nervous man of forty-seven, who had fled from the Cape as he could not bear the summer there, sent for me to see him at his hotel because he did not dare venture out in the middle of the day for fear of being caught in the sun. Lach. soon enabled him to attend garden parties. The delirium of Lach. is of the low, muttering type; at times the patient sinks into a torpid state, with cold extremities, tremor of body and hands, tremor of tongue. Tremor of tongue is a leading feature of many Lach. states. It not only trembles, but it catches in the teeth or lower lip when the patient attempts to put it out. The mind is profoundly disturbed. There are rapidly alternating states: exalted powers, rapid succession of ideas; and again there is weak memory; frequent mistakes in writing; confusion. \"Frantic loquacity, jumps from one subject to another, \", is a strong characteristic; \"talks, sings, or whistles constantly; makes odd motions with arms\"; \"insane jealousy\"; \"intense sadness and anxiety\"; \"irritable, irascible, peevish, malicious.\" A curious symptom in the mental sphere is a derangement of the time sense. It occurs also in Merc. (to which Lach. is an antidote); but is more prominent in Lach., when a patient is always making mistakes in the time of day, and confounds the morning hours with the evening hours, Lach. will generally put this right, if it does no more. Fainting fits and vertigo on closing eyes; on looking intently at any object; in morning on waking. Rush of blood to head. Sun-headaches. Headache with very pale face. Throbbing headaches in temple, with heat of head. Headache extending into nose; > when nasal catarrh comes on. A woman, forty-four, to whom I gave Lach. for a poisoned finger, experienced after each dose a sensation \"as if a hand were in her head, moving and squeezing, \", an eruption of spots came out, and she felt as if she had no energy. The finger healed, but when she left off the medicine on account of the head pains, the finger became worse with cramping pains and a feeling of pins and needles. There is intense nervous irritability, restless, tossing, moving; nervous exaltation, hysteria. Trembling in whole body, thinks she will faint or sink down from weakness. Convulsions, spasms. Cases of hydrophobia have been cured with Lach., the thirst, spasms, sensitiveness and nervous prostration closely corresponding to the symptoms of rabies. Fainting accompanying other complaints is an indication for Lach.: with pain at heart; with nausea; with vertigo and pale face. Catalepsy. Awkward gait; left side weak. Gressus gallinaceus. Disturbances of sight and hearing are numerous. I have frequently cured with it noises in the ears when < after sleep. In hay fever it is the remedy when there is headache extending into nose < on suppression of the discharge, which may occur in sleep; or when the paroxysms are < after sleep. Sore nostrils and lips. Pus and blood from nose. Red nose of drunkards. Dark red eruptions; purplish swellings; black and blue spots are characteristic of Lach. Ulcer sensitive to least touch. Small ulcers surrounding larger. The throat is in an especial degree the seat of the Lach. action. Sore throats of almost all descriptions come within its range, provided some of the characteristics are present: < after sleep; by touch; symptoms < left side or proceeding from left to right; cannot bear any pressure about neck; empty swallowing is agonising, liquids are swallowed with less pain and solids with least pain. Diphtheria, mercurial and syphilitic sore throat. Fetid breath. The prostration is out of all proportion to the appearance of the throat.", "Lach. has sinking at the stomach, and cannot go long without food. Unquenchable thirst. Desires: oysters, wine, coffee (coffee agrees). Symptoms are > after eating, especially after fruit. The throat symptoms are < by hot drinks. Nausea always after drinking. Everything sours; heartburn. Alcoholic drinks < (except the immediate effects of the bite). Although Lach. is a left-side medicine, it has a powerful action on the liver as well as the spleen. \"Acute pain in liver extending towards stomach, \", though contrary to the general \"left to right\" direction, is characteristic, as I can testify. Lach. is also one of the most prominent remedies in appendicitis. The general characteristics will guide here. Bubos. Lach. and Naja have had the greatest success of all homoeopathic remedies in the recent epidemics of Plague in India. The bladder and rectum are most painfully affected. There is a very characteristic symptom in the bladder: Sensation as if a ball were rolling loose in the bladder or abdomen on turning over. The urine is almost black; frequent; foaming; dark. (\"The patient always has to urinate after lying down, day or night, especially after sleep; more frequent in the night. Urine has little black spots or flakes like soot floating in it.\"", "H. N. Martin.) Stitches in kidneys. The ball sensation occurs elsewhere: as if a ball, or lump, or button in throat; as if two balls threatened to close the throat; as if a ball rose from abdomen to throat; as if a plug were in anus. Many severe and characteristic symptoms appear in rectum and anus. Diarrhoea of fetid, cadaverous kind and also constipation. Atony of rectum. Painful haemorrhoids. Visible spasmodic tenesmus in paroxysms, from two to five minutes, extorting cries; passes blood and mucus. Painful constriction of anus followed by collapse. Haemorrhoids with scanty menses. Burning in rectum. Stitch in rectum (upwards) when coughing or sneezing. Full feeling in rectum, and sensation as of little hammers beating. Tugging upward sensation as from a mouse. Both ovaries are affected, but principally the left; swelling, induration, tumours. Menses regular but scanty; pains > when flow is established. In a case of mine, Lach. postponed menses for a week. Many symptoms occur in connection with menses. The breasts are affected. I have seen most obstinate and distressing eruptions appear on the nipples and areolae of a middle-aged woman after a dose of Lach. in high potency. Cancer of the breast when assuming a bluish appearance will be helped by Lach. Lochia are thin, ichorous, insufficient. Milk thin, blue, nipples extremely sensitive to touch. In the respiratory sphere the sensitiveness of the parts to touch, constriction, and < by anything tight round neck, are the ruling conditions. Tickling, irritating cough. The least thing coming near mouth or nose interferes with breathing. Sleeps into an attack of asthma. Threatened paralysis of lungs. The heart feels too large", "cramp-like pain in precordia. Constriction. Palpitation with numbness down arm. Cyanosis. Varicosis. Peculiar sensations of Lach. (in addition to those already mentioned) are: As if frightened by visions behind him; as if knives were being thrust into brow; as if tongue bound or tied up; as if a part of right-side of head cut away; as if a thread was drawn from behind to eye; stitches as from knives in eyes; eyes as if they had been taken out, squeezed and put back; ears as if closed from within; as if stuffed up as if insects whizzing in ears; as if he had a moustache of ice as if a small crumb lodged in throat; as if he had had a blow on neck; as if a stricture in rectum. As if heart hanging by a thread and every beat would tear it off; as though heart turned over and ceased beating for a moment; as if heart hadn't room to beat. As if neck constricted with a cord. (Lach. is one of the remedies for \"gridle pain\") as if burnt or scalded in different parts (tongue, tibia, hypogastrium). Burning sensation and pains are a leading feature throughout this remedy. Lach. is called for in many kinds of fever, particularly intermittents after abuse of Quinine. The symptoms of Lach. are < in spring or summer; from extremes of temperature; from sun's rays; change of weather, especially in a warm spell. Must have open air, which >; but draughts of air < External warmth > (wants head closely wrapped up); hot drinks < thirst; = toothache and bleeding of gums. Cold weather, cold washing <. Most symptoms appear or are < at night and in early morning after sleep. Lying down > pain in head; < vertigo, throat, cough, breathing. Lying right side > earache in right ear; palpitation. Lying left side = pain in heart. > Sitting bent. < Standing or stooping. < Motion generally. < Contact. < Constriction. Swallowing = stitches into ears. > By discharges." ],
