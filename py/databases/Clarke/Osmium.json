    "Characteristics" : [ "Osmium is a metal of the Platinum group, in association with which it is always found. It is the heaviest of them all and the most refractory, having never been fused. It derives its name (οσμη odour) from the pungent odour of the fumes of Osmic acid, which are evolved in the process of separating Platinum from its ore, and the effects of which have supplied a number of valuable symptoms in cases recorded by J. G. Blackley (C. D. P.). In the arts it is used in the alloy with iridium (Iridosmium or Osmiridium) for making the tips of gold pens. Triturations of the pure metal have been proved. The symptoms of the metal and of the acid are taken together. The odour of Osm. closely resembles that of Chlorine, as also do its irritating effect on the respiratory mucous membrane. The odour imparted to the secretions is various it makes the urine smell like violets; the eructations like radishes the axillary sweat like garlic. The respiratory tract is irritated from beginning to end, and not only irritated but pained. The nostrils and larynx are sensitive to cold air. There is pain in larynx, trachea, and in and under sternum on coughing. Even talking causes pain in larynx. Cough convulsive in paroxysms; hollow sounding as if one coughed into an empty tube; caused by irritation in larynx or low down in chest. As with so many remedies causing cough and asthmatic symptoms, Osm. is no less irritating to the skin, producing all degrees of irritating eruptions, eczematous and herpetic. In one of Blackley's cases a child born during the time that his father was under the influence of Osm. ac. developed eczema, though none of the previously born children were eczematous. In one of the provers the eruption proceeded from above downwards, the eruption disappearing from the upper part of the body and becoming worse on the lower. The downward direction of the symptoms also appeared in the male generative sphere, which was profoundly influenced: \"Weakness in both groins towards cords.\" C. M. Boger (Med. Couns., xvi. 264) cured a case in which there was pain in both directions: \"Stitching pain upward in left spermatic cord. Creeping sensation downwards in left spermatic cord. Weakness in calves; they give out while walking.\" [Shootings in the sternum are \"up and down.\"] In another case (man, syphilitic) he cured: \"Dull, steady pain in hypogastrium, sore to pressure. Steady aching in glans penis.\" In the provings the erections were severe almost to priapism, and the ejaculations were longer-lasting and more copious than normal. The kidneys were affected in one of Blackley's cases, incipient nephritis being set up. The headaches of the provings were of a violent description, many of them affecting the base of the brain. A woman, to whom I once gave Osm. 2x for a spasmodic cough with pain in the head had a severe aggravation, the headache taking this form: \"Sharp pain in centre of forehead going through to back; > by hard pressure on forehead.\" She discontinued Osm. and in two or three days that pain went away, leaving only an ordinary headache. The cough was not relieved. G. S. Norton (H. W., xviii. 263) suggests that Osm. may be a remedy in many cases of glaucoma. Among the peculiar sensations are: As of a band round head. As if he had swallowed broken stones. Cough as if caused by resonance of contiguous parts. As if insects crawling on back and shoulders. Legs and feet as if too full. The symptoms are < by touch (tongue, sternum). < Riding (hoarseness). < Coughing; talking (pain in larynx). Most symptoms are < evening (cough, skin, restlessness). Cough < till midnight. Open air < (coryza, cough). (One prover was less liable to taking cold in November than usual.) Open air > (smarting in eyes)." ],
