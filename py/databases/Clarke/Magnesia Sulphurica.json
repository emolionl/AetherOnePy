    "Characteristics" : [ "The ancient reputation of Mag. sul. as a \"refrigerant cathartic\" under the familiar name of \"Epsom Salts, \", or \"salts\" par excellence, has overshadowed its homoeopathic uses. But Mag. s. is something more than a \"refrigerant cathartic.\" Fatal poisoning has occurred from an overdose, death apparently occurring from collapse; and the proving of the salts produced many symptoms of utter prostration. Recently old-school authorities have discovered in this \"cathartic\" a remedy for dysentery. It is the chief ingredient in many laxative mineral waters and popular saline aperient mixtures. The provings bring out effects common to the other Magnesias: Tearfulness; restless uneasiness; pains in facial bones; sensitiveness to touch; > by walking. The diuretic action of the drug with great thirst has led to its successful use in diabetes. The diarrhoea is accompanied with great thirst. The chill is accompanied or followed by thirst. Shuddering in back from below upward. The toothache is < coming into a room out of cold air, < by contact with food, whether cold or warm. It is also > in bed. According to Med. Press (Sept. 1891), eight cases of new growth having all the outward characters of epithelioma have been cured by Graves with teaspoonful doses of a solution of three drachms to the pint. Warts are allied to epithelioma, and H. T. Webster (quoted H. R., x. 542) has cured many cases in children, giving as much of the salts as would lie on a clime (sixpenny piece) three times a day. One boy was literally covered with warts, his face being much disfigured. One girl of was cured of large warts on her hands. F. H. Pritchard (H. M., xxxv. 691) gives his experience with Mag. s. (1/2 gr. in a teaspoonful of water) in summer diarrhoea, with vomiting of food, copious yellowish, slimy, and stinking stools, and later merely watery serum. The first sign of improvement was that the stools became bile-tinged, after which they soon became of thicker consistency. The copiousness of the stools seemed to be the cardinal indication." ],
