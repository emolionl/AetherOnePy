    "Clinical" : [ "Dysentery." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Pel. ren. (G. M. H. in H. W., xxxiv. 546) is a Kafir remedy for dysentery. The root is cut up very fine or bruised, and then boiled in milk for a considerable time. Many British soldiers were cured of dysentery with it in the Boer War. It is also used for purging in horses. When a horse is attacked during a journey the root (which is very thick) is wrapped up and tied to the bit. The juice mingles with the saliva and is swallowed." ]
