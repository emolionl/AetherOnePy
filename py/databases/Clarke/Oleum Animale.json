    "Characteristics" : [ "Ol. an. is an empyreumatic oil obtained in the preparation of bone-black, and further distilled and rectified for medicinal use. It was discovered in by Johann Conrad Dippel, the alchemist, and discoverer of Prussian-blue. Dippel obtained it in the first instance by distillation of stags' horns: hence the name Oleum cornu cervi, with which the Ol. an. as at present prepared is considered identical; the deciduous horns of the stag partaking more of the nature of bone than the permanent horns of cattle. As rectified it is \"a colourless or slightly yellow, thin, oily liquid, with a penetrating but not disagreeable odour and an acrid, burning taste, which changes to a cool and bitter one. It darkens and thickens on exposure to air and light, and is extremely volatile. A drop on paper evaporates without leaving a greasy stain.\" Its composition is extremely complex, but it may be regarded as belonging to the group of volatile carbons. Sircar (Calc. J. of Med., xvi. 249) gives an interesting account of Ol. an., and quotes from Hahn. Adv. of April, a valuable paper on the remedy by C. L. Olds with a discussion thereon. Though it is not the panacea which Dippel imagined it to be when he discovered it, Ol. an. is a very powerful medicinal substance, and since it has been well proved by Nenning, Schreter, and Trinks, it has a definite place in the homoeopathic materia medica. As is usually the case with combustive products, Ol. an. has burning pains and burning sensations in almost all parts, and like the carbons and K. carb. it has also stitches and sometimes combinations of the two, \"stitches as with red-hot needles.\" Stitches and pressure may be in all directions, but from behind forward is particularly characteristic. \"Stitches from behind forward in breasts; pressure from both sides of the back extends forward.\" Guided by the former I gave great relief in a case of scirrhus of right breast in which pains darting forward out of the nipple were complained of. \"Pulled upward\" is another characteristic sensation. It occurs in the malar bones: \"Sensation in both malar bones as if pulled forcibly upward.\" And it also occurs in the testicles. \"Both testicles are drawn up and very painful.\" This led to the cure of a \"long-standing neuralgia of spermatic cord; excruciating attacks three or four times every year; pains as if testicles were seized by a hand and pulled very severely.\" Ol. an. gave almost instant and permanent relief (Blakely Raue's Rec., p. 241). The cure of a case of migraine is quoted in H. M., July, Zwingenberg, after failing with Sang., gave Ol. an. 2x, five drops in warm water, morning and evening, to a lady who always suffered from migraine the day after a fashionable party, at which she usually wore a heavy diadem on her head. Polyuria of perfectly clear urine accompanied the migraine and suggested the remedy. This accompaniment may indicate Ol. an. in any nervous disorder. Zwingenberg also cured a case of nervous asthma following repelled foot-sweat. In the discussion on Olds' paper some cures were mentioned. Dever cured toothache in an extremely irritable patient, pain > by pressing the teeth together. The provings have \"stitches in right upper molar removed by pressure, after dinner.\" Dr. Leggett related one case: A very stout Dutch lady, (who had been under constitutional treatment for uterine tumour, engorged liver and cerebral congestion), presented the following symptoms: Sensation as if water rushing back and forth in stomach; fancied the tumour had increased to size it was years ago. She had been walking, standing, and shopping, and had eaten many sweets. Of the remedies having \"stomach as if full of water, \", Ol. an. was chosen as more similar to the case than Mill. or Phell., and was given in 1m attenuation, a single dose. A month later she was better in every way, and a second dose brought still further improvement. This case in connection with my case of breast tumour still further shows the relationship of Ol. an. to new growths. Olds in his paper brings out the striking and peculiar symptoms of the remedy very clearly. Olds speaks of a proving by himself, but he gives no details of it. Some symptoms mentioned by him I cannot find in Allen or Hering. These I have entered in the Schema and give his authority for each. The Conditions of Ol. an. give the most characteristic general features: > from rubbing; < from eating. < In warm room. > In open air. These are general, but there are exceptions. Among the Peculiar Symptoms mentioned by Olds are: Twitching of lips and swelling beneath right lower jaw. Malar bone feels as if pulled forcibly upward. Greasy feeling in mouth and accumulation of quantities of saliva white as snow. Relaxation of buccal mucous membrane, patient cannot avoid biting cheek when he eats. Soreness of tongue as if scalded. Sensation as of white of egg dried on lips. Sensation as if cold air penetrated throat although the air is warm; > eating and drinking, < empty swallowing. Desire for soft-boiled eggs or for bread only with aversion to meat. Sensation as if water were in stomach; as if a lump of ice there. Eructations taste like urine, and burn. Sensation as if testicles were seized and pulled forcibly upward. Menses too early and too scanty. Cracking in vertebrae of neck on raising head. Sensation in scalp as if skin had been cut and reunited. Other sensations are: As if blood were rushing to head; to occiput on entering a warm room. As if red-hot needles in chest. As if thumb (and toe) would ulcerate. Cramp-like pains in different parts. Indolence and inclined to sit; taciturn; ill-tempered. Winans (Med. Adv., xix. 503) gave Ol. an. with success in a case of bilious fever, the patient being a rather fleshy old lady. The indicating symptoms were: Slow pulse (55). Desire for soft-boiled eggs. Itching of left lower eyelid. Sad mood; morose; nothing delights her. Absorbed in self, sad, speaks little. Sepia was required to complete the case, one of the new symptoms being yellowness of palms of hands. The left side is predominantly affected; when direction is noted it is from before backward and from behind upward. > By rubbing is very characteristic. > By stretching. > By pressure. Ol. an. is a chilly medicine, but the chilliness (and also coryza) are < in a warm room and > in open air. Tearing in all fingers is > by washing in cold water. Drinking cold water = pressure in stomach. < From hot drinks. Motion > some rheumatic pains. Raising head = cracking of vertebrae. < Eating (sweat; lachrymation; headache). Especially < after dinner. > Swallowing food or drink, < empty swallowing (throat). < By motion; by mental exertion. > Changing position. Sneezing = bursting pain in chest. The majority of symptoms are < in afternoon; also p.m. < Before, during and commencement of menses. < By noise (noises in the head)." ],
