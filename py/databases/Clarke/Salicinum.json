    "Characteristics" : [ "Saln. is an active principle (glucoside?) obtained from different species of Willow. It has been used largely in the treatment of rheumatism in ordinary practice. It has had some fragmentary provings, and Ringer experimented with it on three boys. The characteristics of the Salicylic acid compounds were prominent", "giddiness, confusion of the head, flickering before the eyes, and tinnitus. The stomach was disordered, vomiting occurred. There was also great instability of temperature. Chilliness, high temperature, and low temperature were induced. Saln. has been commended in influenza by Stephen Mackenzie as less irritating than the Salicylates and more effective." ],
