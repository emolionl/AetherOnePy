    "Clinical" : [ "Leucorrhoea. Warts." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "This preparation of Calcarea has been used in preference to others in cases of simple bland leucorrhoea. Water in which eggs have been boiled is popularly supposed to have the property of causing warts if brought in contact with the hands. This suggests Calc. ov. test. as possibly the best Calcarea preparation to prescribe in cases of warts. No doubt Calc. ov. test. has the general properties of Calc. carb. ostrear. (i.e., ordinary Calc. carb.), but it has been little used clinically, \"Backache, as if broken in two, \", is a keynote." ]
