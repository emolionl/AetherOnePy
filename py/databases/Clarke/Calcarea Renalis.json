Following a repercussed eruption he had among a host of other troubles renal colic of great intensity, with passage of uric acid calculi. One of these was triturated in the proportion of parts to of sugar of milk, and of this he took 1/2 grain doses for a considerable time, with the result that the formation of calculi ceased, the tartar which had formed on the teeth dropped off, and a nodosity of stony hardness disappeared from the extensor tendon of the right middle finger." ]
