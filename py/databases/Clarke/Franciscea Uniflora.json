    "Clinical" : [ "Headache. Pericarditis. Rheumatism. Syphilis." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Franciscea u. is a Brazilian remedy of great local repute as an anti-syphilitic and anti-rheumatic. It is called \"vegetable mercury.\" In large doses it is a poison, causing violent purgation and emesis. Many cases of acute, sub-acute, and chronic cases of rheumatism have been reported cured with the tincture by homoeopaths; also pericarditis complicating rheumatism. Hansen gives these symptoms as characteristic, though I do not know of any proving: \"Intense headache like a band around the head, pain in occiput, neck and spine, lancinating, sticking; terrible aching all over, with great heat, followed by profuse sweat, which > all symptoms.\"" ]
