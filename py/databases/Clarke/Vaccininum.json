    "Characteristics" : [ "Vaccinia, Small-pox, and Grease of horses are inter-related diseases, and the nosodes of each are available for the treatment or prevention of manifestations of all three. The vaccine poison is capable of setting up a morbid state of extreme chronicity, named by Burnett Vaccinosis. And it may do this without causing the primary symptoms: when the vaccination apparently does not \"take.\" The symptoms of vaccinosis are protean, and are for the most part identical with the symptoms of the Sycosis of Hahnemann. Vaccinosis is a sycotic disease. Neuralgias, inveterate skin eruptions, chilliness, indigestion with great flatulent distension, are leading features of the vaccinal dyscrasia, and therefore indications for the nosode. There is another disease to which vaccinia is related, and that is whooping-cough. Some years ago an old-school observer vaccinated for some reason a child whilst suffering from whooping-cough, and the whooping-cough vanished. He repeated the experiment in other cases, and with such signal success that he wrote to the journals to recommend it as a routine practice in the case of unvaccinated children. On the other hand, homoeopathic observers have seen whooping-cough follow immediately on vaccination, and have cured it with Thuj. Turiansky (B. M. J., December 1891) tried hypodermic injections of freshly collected calf vaccine in a series of cases of tuberculosis of the lung apices, and states that they were \"invariably, though somewhat slowly, followed by most decided amelioration both of the subjective and objective phenomena.\" The temperature became normal, appetite and sleep improved, night-sweats, dyspnoea, muscular weakness, and painful sensations decreased; cough lessened or disappeared; sputa became thicker and whiter, pulse slower; urine increased; body weight increased; bacilli decreased and degenerated. The exact amount and form of the injections is not stated. Here is a case in the potencies: Garrison (N. A. J. H., quoted H. R., x. 278) was consulted by a lady, of phthisical family. She had consolidation of both apices; had been losing flesh for three months; severe night-sweats; almost constant, hacking cough, with considerable expectoration at times. Vacc. one dose. In a week she reported that she had not had a severe coughing spell since the dose, and for the last three days hardly any cough at all. She received one dose of Vacc. a week, and at the end of six weeks returned to business. If a child has a naevus it is the rule, when possible, to vaccinate on the naevus. The inflammation and subsequent scarring destroy the growth. But that does not completely explain the cure: vaccinia is causally related to the production of new growths. Over a year ago a young lady came to me shortly after having been revaccinated under some Government rule. There had been nothing abnormal in the course of the vaccinia, but after the scabs fell off there was much pain in the arm, and each of the scars began to grow, and when I saw them were well-developed cheloids. Thuja removed the pains but did not arrest the growth. Under Malan. they have now all but disappeared. Frolich (B. M. J., October 1898) relates the case of a child, 1/2, who had well-developed nephritis seven days after vaccination with calf vaccine. The first symptom was puffed eyelids, then pain and swelling of scrotum; on the fourteenth day the urine contained blood, inguinal glands enlarged and tender, slight oedema of legs. The urine contained blood and alumen for another month, when recovery took place. Other cases of this kind have been observed. The symptoms of the Schema are partly pathogenetic and partly cured. Peculiar Sensations are: As if forehead were split. As if heated or over-exerted in lower extremities. As if bones of leg were broken and undergoing process of comminution. Burnett says the < time of Vacc. is the early morning. One symptom is: \"Waked in middle of night by pain in forehead and eyes as if split, and stinging in temples.\"" ],
