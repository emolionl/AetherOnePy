    "Characteristics" : [ "This medicine was originally used by H. Nankivell, on analogical grounds, in cases of phthisis. It has had a short, independent proving, and symptoms observed on patients have increased the pathogenesis. The Conditions resemble more closely those of Arsen. than those of Iod.: < from cold wind; > warmth. Great vital prostration. < From any exertion.", "It is a medicine of wide range and great power. Chronic inflammatory states of the lungs and bronchial tubes, with profuse, greenish-yellow, pus-like expectoration and short breath are especially relieved by it. Kent observed in a proving made by himself that a thick, yellow discharge resembling honey is characteristic, and he cured with it a case of disease of the nasal bones, with weak intellect, in a girl, being guided by the symptom: \"Discharge excoriating, thick, and yellow.\" There was also great improvement in the mental state. Hale's keynote of the remedy is: The peculiar and persistently irritating, corrosive character of all the discharges. In hay-fever, otorrhoea, and leucorrhoea, with fetid, corrosive discharge, and in diarrhoea where the evacuations \"scald, \", it is indicated. It has been used successfully in tumours, including epithelioma. L. B. Wells cured a case of left axillary tumour in a lady aet. A gland the size of a hen's egg, exuding a fluid which formed a hard, brown crust. The tumour was painful and very sensitive. Left breast enlarged, indurated, and very sore. There was also yellow, bloody, and irritating leucorrhoea with swelling of labia (Hale). In many cases of weakened heart I have found Ars. iod. of signal service, more especially when associated with chronic lung conditions. Many skin affections have been remedied by it; particularly dry, scaly, burning and itching eruptions as psoriasis, tinea, impetigo, pityriasis. The consumption-diathesis is in itself a strong indication for the remedy.", "During the influenza epidemic in this country Ars. iod. was specific for \"pink-eye, \", the form it took among horses, but it was not found of such general utility among human patients.", "Ars. iod. has a marked action on the stomach, and when given low needs to be given after food, if unpleasant symptoms are to be avoided. In one patient there was nausea immediately after each dose. In another there was aggravation of a pain he had in the epigastrium, and vomiting one hour after food. An observer reported in the Lancet the following: \"At first appetite is increased but after taking it ten or twelve days pain is felt at epigastrium, with thirst, dry throat, slight fever, sometimes diarrhoea and tenesmus; skin becomes dry, and the quantity of urine increased. If continued the nervous system becomes extremely irritable and wakefulness supervenes.\" In several persons taking low attenuations I have observed headaches confirming those of the provers. From the 3x a woman experienced this: \"Violent, dull, heavy pain above root of nose, as if she would go silly.\" She never had anything of the kind before. From the 1x a man had \"a heavy headache, across forehead, as if he would like to go to sleep; so weak he could hardly move about.\" All ceased when he had finished the medicine. Wandering rheumatic pains were felt by one prover. Great vital prostration. Paralysis." ],
