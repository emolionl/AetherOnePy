It has not been proved, but the indications for its use have been defined by experience as follows: Rapid and feeble action of the heart; dropsy; scanty urine with albumen and casts. Valvular disease and cardiac asthma. There is no record of its use in the potencies. Cash gave great relief to \"a water-logged patient of seventy-four\" with mitral regurgitation, with one-grain doses of Adonidin at eight-hour intervals, after failure of Arsenicum and Digitalis. Urinary secretion rose from half a pint to 1/2 pints in twenty-four hours. Breathing was relieved; sleep returned." ],
