    "Characteristics" : [ "This is an unproved drug, but it has been used with a good deal of success in cases of cataract as an external application. The method adopted is to instil one drop, four or five times a day, into the eye affected, and to keep this up for several months. Traumatic cataract and corneal opacities, as well as senile cataract, have been removed in this way. I have seen no reports of cures by internal use of the remedy alone, but in some cases it was given internally as well as used externally. Generally the patients have received specific homoeopathic treatment internally at the same time." ]
