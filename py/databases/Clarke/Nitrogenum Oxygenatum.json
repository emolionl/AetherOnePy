    "Clinical" : [ "Enuresis. Epilepsy. Hysteria. Lungs, congestion of." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "This well-known anaesthetic, introduced by Sir Humphrey Davy, has given rise to some pathological symptoms which I have collected in the Schema. Some of them were observed by myself on a girl of twelve who had congestion of the right lung setting in within a few hours of the anaesthesia (H. W., xxv. 64); and on a man, who had blisters round his mouth, inside, on two occasions after being under gas; was troubled with drowsiness for weeks after, and had acneous spots on his face. Others are from the observations of Mr. Silk (H. W., xxv. 462); and the rest are from provings recorded by Allen. Silk observed that females were very much more liable to ill effects than males. One of his patients, an epileptic girl, otherwise healthy, when he removed the face-piece, struggled to get her hands up, and afterwards described her feelings as \"pain in the forehead where the aura commenced.\" In one epileptic patient (not Mr. Silk's) a fit actually did occur. Rhythmic movement of the arms or legs is a common occurrence. One prover had his piles cured as an incidental result of his experiments." ],
