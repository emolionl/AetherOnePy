    "Characteristics" : [ "The Arsenite of Quinine combines many of the properties of its two components, but having been proved it can be treated as a separate individuality. The periodicity is intensified, and this is especially noted in the neuralgias. An irritable mood precedes the headache, which is < by mental and bodily exercise. The gastralgia of Chi. ars. is pressure in solar plexus with tender spine just at back of it. Nausea and vomiting are followed by sleep. Bonino (H. R., iv 210), who gave it a prolonged proving, found the symptoms < at rest; in the morning; and when the stomach was empty. They were > by motion (vertigo); and by eating (gastralgia). The chief effects were manifested on the stomach, solar plexus, ligaments and skin. According to him it corresponds to tobacco intoxication and its effects; indigestion from unripe fruits; gastralgia from coarse food or ill-baked bread; chronic rheumatism of joints without swelling; tertiary syphilis of periosteum; colic from incarcerated flatus; intermittent fever with predominating chills, little thirst and continuous almost convulsive yawning; effects of severe and depressing influences on the mind; to convalescence from long-lasting sickness. The circulation was slow, and limbs relaxed. Weakness, prostration, and disinclination for mental exertion were marked in several provers." ],
