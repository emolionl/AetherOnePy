Indian women drink a decoction of it before confinement to make labour safe and easy. Eclectics use a concentrated decoction as an application to sore nipples. T. C. Duncan, in his proving, induced pains and burning in the kidneys, and H. P. Hale, who observed the effect on a woman, has recorded some characteristic symptoms in the urinary and uterine sphere. A leading indication is congestion of the uterus with bladder irritation as a concomitant." ],
