    "Clinical" : [ "Cancer. Freckles. Headache. Lupus. Menses, premature. Paralysis. Sunburn. Sunstroke." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Thanks to Finsen, of Copenhagen, the place of Light in therapeutics is on the way to be defined so far as its direct properties are concerned, though Finsen is reviving and confirming, rather than originating, light-therapy. O. V. Thayer (H. R., viii. 463) published in a series of cases in which he had used concentrated rays of sun-light (solar cautery), including cases of epithelial cancer, rodent ulcer, parasitic diseases, moles, small wens, birth-marks, &c. H. T. Webster (H. R., xv. 126) gives details of a case of epithelioma in which the growth was removed by solar-cautery and a scarcely perceptible scar left. Swan and his coadjutors investigated sun-light from another point of view. In 188o (Org., iii. 275) Swan published a pathogenesis of Sol, which I have embodied in my Schema. Swan's data were obtained from four provers, from experiences obtained from sensitives by Reichenbach (Der Sensitive Mench), from an observation by \"Highwood\" quoted by Fincke from American Observer, ix. Reichenbach's observations I have distinguished by \"(R), \", Highwood's by \"(H).\" The remaining symptoms are those who took principally the 1m attenuations of Fincke. The 15m was taken by one. Two of Reichenbach's symptoms were observed on two of the provers also, and the letters \"(F)\" and \"(L)\" refer to these. Cured symptoms will be found in brackets. The common effects of strong sun-light, as sneezing, freckling, and sunstroke, my be added to the list." ],

    "Mind" : [ "Excitement and anxiousness in all her nerves, at first with trembling at heart, finally it remained in stomach-pit; all that night and next day very sensitive and easily frightened; it was as if all the nerves were trembling inside of them; the anxiousness in stomach-pit passes off the second evening.", "Anxiousness if somebody comes towards her, being frightened thereat (F and R)." ],
    "Head" : [ "Violent headache from vertex down to forehead, pressing, with sensation of heat in face; this headache was repeated the second day three times; it seems to be in connection with the excitement and anxiousness at stomach-pit (first night).", "All the sensitives are very sensitive to the immediate action of sunshine on the vertex (R).", "Extreme painfulness if the sunshine strike the bare-head (R).", "Most violent stitches in brain (R).", "Disagreeable feelings, such as from retrograde passes, go into brain, cause stitches and headache, and if she does not gain the shade, stomach-ache and nausea follow (R).", "Violent headache (R).", "L.", "sided headache (R).", "Headache from sunshine on bare head, > by laying a glass of water on stomach-pit (R).", "In morning, severe pain in crown, and then in neck, passing off after breakfast (L and R).", "(Heavy pressive pain in vertex.).", "Intense entire cephalalgia.", "Pain in forehead; it seems as if forehead would crush itself down upon the eyes.", "(Sensation of undulating or floating in head after mental excitement, such as attending to business or writing a letter.).", "Instantaneous shock to brain, followed by prostration, and a scalding sensation on top of head (remedied by orange-coloured cloth in stove-pipe hat) (H).", "Excessive perspiration of head and neck." ],
