    "Characteristics" : [ "Hale quotes T. O. Summers (Nashville J. of Med. and Surg.) as saying that Li. ben. had great effect in diminishing uric acid deposits and increasing the free hippuric acid of the urine. \"It acts upon the urine before it leaves the blood.\" Bearing in mind the powerful action which each of its elements possesses over the urinary functions, homoeopaths can understand this action, and future experience will probably extend it." ]
