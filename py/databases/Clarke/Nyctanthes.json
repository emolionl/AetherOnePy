    "Characteristics" : [ "Nyctanthes is a small tree of the jasmine family, having brilliant, highly fragrant flowers, white and yellow, which do not expand till evening and which fall off about sunrise. Thus during the day the tree loses all its brightness, and hence is called \"The Sad Tree\" (Arbor tristis). \"Nyctanthes\" means \"Night-flowering.\" S. C. Ghose has given an account of the medicinal properties of this plant (H. W., xxxvi. 24). He has used it extensively in cases of bilious and remittent fevers, rheumatism and sciatica, and the constipation of children. It is \"bitter, tonic, and expectorant, and a mild purgative.\" In the fever there is thirst before and during chills, and bitter vomiting at close of chill. Not much sweat. Ghose compares it with Eupat. perf. He has made a short proving of it." ],
