    "Characteristics" : [ "The use of the Pitcher Plant in small-pox is a discovery of the Indians of North America, the spotted appearance of the plant probably suggesting a resemblance to the disease. Hale has collected much confirmatory evidence of its power to antidote the small-pox poison. A proving by T. C. Duncan, Thomas, and others brought out symptoms of fever, backache, headache, and gastric disturbance. Hering quotes these instances of its action: (1) A woman far advanced in pregnancy was cured of small-pox with Sarr. and delivery being happily accomplished during her convalescence, the infant bearing on its body numerous red blotches, indicating that it had been affected with the disease. (2) An infant a few months old was attacked with a grave form of small-pox, with variolous angina so severe that it was with difficulty it could take the breast; the mother took Sarr. and and continued to nurse the infant, which promptly recovered, the mother not taking the disease. (3) In an epidemic occurring in the environs of Wavre, Sarr. was given to two thousand persons living in the very middle of the disease and coming in constant intercourse with it, but all who took Sarr. escaped; during the same epidemic two hundred cases were treated with Sarr. without a death. Bilden, who used the 1x tincture in an epidemic with success, concludes that Sarr. is to small-pox what Gels. is to bilious fever. Hale quotes Surgeon-Major C. G. Logie's (allopath) account of his experience with Sarr. (decoction probably) in small-pox: \"Four of the cases in my hospital have been severe confluent cases. They have throughout the disease all been perfectly sensible, have had excellent appetites, been free from pain, and have never felt weak. The effects of this medicine, which I have carefully watched, seemed to arrest the development of the pustules, killing, as it were, the virus from within, thereby changing the character of the disease and doing away with pitting.\" A number of eye symptoms appeared in the provings, and Sarr. has cured disordered vision. A case of \"phlyctenoid herpes\" has also been reported cured by it. Extreme lassitude and pains in the bones were prominent in the provings. The right side was more affected than the left. Sensations were: Light feeling in head. As if he received a knock on the head. As if head were split. Left eye as if congested. Heat in face as if on fire. Swelling in womb as if from a tumour or dropsy. Uterus swollen as if full of cysts. As if bones of leg were too thick. Sarr. has the empty, hungry, sinking sensation of the antipsorics. Dryness of mouth and throat. Weak feeling in the arms. Very sensitive to cold air. Faint after stool. There is vesical and rectal tenesmus. Stool smells of musk. The symptoms were < about midnight and at p.m. < Morning. < Rising from lying. < Trying to walk. < In stormy weather. Open air = chilliness, hands and feet cold; = head to be hot and sore, and feet full. Cold air = to feel chilly and < bone pains. Symptoms generally > in fresh air; and > out of bed." ],
