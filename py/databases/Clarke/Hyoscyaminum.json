    "Characteristics" : [ "Hyos. sul. is a very powerful poison obtained from Hyos. nig. It is sometimes used by occulists in place of Atropine to dilate the pupils for the purposes of ophthalmoscopic examination, and like Atropine it has the property of causing dryness of the mouth and fauces in some cases. Two cases have been recorded in which, whilst dilating the pupil, it caused intense boring pain in the eyes from cramp of the ciliary muscle. Dr. H. A. Hutchinson, who took gr. 1/4 of Hyos. sul., became flushed, arteries throbbing, lost power of co-ordination, fell into a comatose sleep, pulse respiration temperature 106Â° F., entire relaxation of voluntary muscles, except occasional spasmodic movement of arms and legs. The hydrobromate of Hyoscine, gr. 1/43, in solution, caused in a tall, robust lady, of 33: Numbness of body and limbs, dry throat, dim vision, flushed face, rambling talk, dilated pupils.", "No specific differences between the two alkaloids have been observed. The majority of the symptoms of the Schema are the effect of the Sulphate, which was extensively proved by Harley. Hyos. hydrobro. 3x trit. has been reported curative in a case resembling paralysis agitans after excessive use of alcohol and tobacco; and in highly excitable, nervous children who have been frightened. The hydrobromate of Hyoscyamine is credited with relieving the tremors (right side) in a case of paralysis agitans, the curative effect having followed instillation of the alkaloid into the eye for another purpose. With the 4x attenuation of Merk's, Hyos. hydrobro., Delameter relieves the tremors of disseminated sclerosis." ],
