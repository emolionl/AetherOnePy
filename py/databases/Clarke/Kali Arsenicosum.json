    "Characteristics" : [ "It is not possible to separate entirely the pathogenesis of Ars. alb. and Kali ars. Kali ars. is the favourite form in which Arsenic is prescribed by the allopaths, consequently the bulk of observations from over-dosing are due to this preparation; and as it is named Liquor arsenicalis it is considered as Arsenic and nothing else. However, a sufficient number of pure observations have been made to warrant a separate consideration. The cases of poisoning with massive doses present nothing to distinguish them from cases poisoned with other arsenical preparations. But Kali ars. has had a short proving, and a number of cases of medicinal provings in allopathic hands are on record. Jonathan Hutchinson has recorded a number of cases of right-side herpes. One of his patients observed that whilst taking Kali ars. her sclerotics became thick and yellow instead of clear and bluish. The iris which was blue became more grey. Her skin instead of being fair and florid became muddy and older looking. This was a mystery to Hutchinson seeing that he usually gave Kali ars. to make the skin clearer, but he was compelled to record the homoeopathic fact, though, he did not apparently perceive the homoeopathic solution of the mystery. The same authority has put on record cases of epithelioma developing after prolonged medication with Kali ars. for psoriasis. The skin symptoms of Kali ars. are exceedingly well marked. In one case an attack of measles was almost exactly depicted. Itching was < at night; and < on undressing, < by warmth. Among the peculiar symptoms of Kali ars. are: \"Head feels larger.\" \"Protrusion of eyeballs.\" \"Burning and numbness of tongue; tongue feels too large.\" \"Sensation of a ball rising from pit of stomach to larynx causing suffocation.\" \"As if a red-hot iron were in anus.\" Periodicity was marked as with Ars.; symptoms were < every other day in the morning; mind symptoms < every third day. The right-sidedness of Ars. was reproduced in the right-sided herpes, repeatedly noticed by Hutchinson, but there was a left-sided headache. A case of deafness of years' standing was cured with Fowler's Solution (gr. 1/60 of the salt), the accompaniment being constant sickness; nothing could be kept down." ],
    "Relations" : [ "In some cases of overdosing Kali iod. proved antidotal. For other antidotes see Arsen., which it greatly resembles, and with which it must be compared.
