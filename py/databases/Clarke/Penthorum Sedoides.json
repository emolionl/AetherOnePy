    "Characteristics" : [ "Penth. was proved by Dr. D. B. Morrow (twice), Dr. Scudder, and a young man, who all took substantial doses. The majority of the symptoms are Morrow's, including the catarrhal symptoms, which have been verified in practice: \"A peculiar wet feeling in nares as though a violent coryza would set in, \", but it did not; the secretion became thickened and pus-like but not increased. The same \"wet feeling\" was experienced at the same time in trachea and bronchi, which passed from above down as if coryza would set in, followed by a slight feeling of constriction in the chest, which also passed from above down. The next day the nose felt stuffed. The third day the first symptoms were repeated, and the discharge became thick, pus-like, and streaked with blood, and there was an odour in the nose as if from an open sore. Scudder had \"fulness in nose and ears.\" Morrow experienced itching at anus, haemorrhoids, and pains and sensations in rectum, sacrum, and sacro-iliac joints; his first proving cured \"heat and soreness in sacrum with a dull, heavy headache.\" Hale says Penth. is reputed to be curative in catarrh and in diarrhoea. A scalded sensation in the tongue is one of the symptoms. A sense of levitation was also produced. The symptoms proceed from above downward. Morrow (Med. Adv., xviii. 540) reports these cures: (1) Miss P., blonde, had severe cough of several weeks' duration. < Talking or singing. Frothy, greenish sputa. Pul. and Pho. failed; Penth. s. soon cured. (2) Decrepit old lady, sufferer from eczema for twelve years. Previous winter cured of asthma (probably from suppressed eczema) with Sul. c.m. Now paretic right side, for which Pho. was given. But Pho. did not relieve a loose, continual, rattling cough, caused by tickling at bifurcation of bronchi, with raising much thick, frothy, greenish sputa. Penth. O pellets quickly cured." ],
