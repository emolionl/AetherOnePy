    "Characteristics" : [ "Iberis is one of the many remedies introduced into homoeopathy by Hale. The genus was named by Dioscorides from Iberia (Spain), its supposed original habitat. Old-school authorities had mentioned Iberis as useful in the treatment of hypertrophy of the heart. This led Hale to have the remedy proved. Sylvester (old school) had observed that Iber. controlled \"the violence and sharp action of the heart and softened the pulse; hence its great service in hypertrophy.\" Hale's provers confirmed this observation, the pulse being softened even during palpitations. Hale considers that the primary depressing action is transient, the secondary, exciting action more persistent. The cardiac symptoms of the drug are very pronounced and well marked, consisting of pains dull or stitching, with palpitation and breathlessness on slightest exertion; pains down the left arm and numbness; intermittent pulse. The concomitant symptoms are well marked. Fulness and heat in head and neck; vertigo; nausea. The excessive nervousness and frightened condition so frequently found associated with heart affections was pronounced in the provings. Cold hands and feet. Choking sensation in the throat was also marked. The stools were white as those of Digit. A common symptom was \"On turning on left side a sharp sticking pain is felt as if a needle were crosswise in the ventricles and pricked at each contraction.\" Sharp stinging pains from before backward. The symptoms are < at night, and in the morning on rising; on the slightest exertion, as laughing or coughing; on stooping; on walking; on lying down; lying on left side; on turning in bed. At the same time trembling weakness and nervousness cause desire to lie down. < By sitting still; in afternoon; in open air. Proctor (H. W., xxxv., 489) has related his own experience with this remedy. After an attack of influenza of moderate intensity in he suffered from cardiac weakness for over two years. Every waking moment was attended with cardiac distress. On the least agitation the weakness developed into irregular palpitation with great anxiety. < From tobacco, which had to be discarded; < from wine, except port. After all the usual remedies had been taken in vain, he took Iber. O, one drop in a powder on the tongue, two or three times a day. \"After about ten days the heart fell almost suddenly into its perfect, regular, unconscious beat, and retired at once and finally from further observation.\" Proctor has repeatedly given Iber. since then in similar cases with the same success. \"Conscious of heart's action\" may possibly prove a keynote for its use." ],
