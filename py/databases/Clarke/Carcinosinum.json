    "Clinical" : [ "Cancer Melancholia. Worms." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "This is one of the principal nosodes of cancer, and is one of Dr. Burnett's preparations. I use it more frequently than any other as a diathesic remedy. Burnett had a number of different cancer preparations, and followed his instinct largely in their use and selection. In addition to Scirrhinum, of which I have given an account in the Dictionary, he had a preparation which he named Durum (a Latinised form of Scirrhinum, as I take it). This he used in treating depraved inherited conditions in children, such as infantile self-abuse, with good effects, which I have confirmed. I have met with a suicidal tendency in several cancer patients, so that the cancer nosodes may be appropriate in many mental cases, especially where the heredity points that way." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Compare: Scirrhinum." ]
