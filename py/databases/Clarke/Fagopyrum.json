    "Characteristics" : [ "Fagopyrum has had an extensive proving, and though there is little clinical experience with the drug on record, some features are sufficiently well marked to justify their being classed as characteristics. One of the most marked symptoms is a visible pulsation of the carotids and other arteries. Offensiveness distinguishes many excretions. Headaches involving eyes, root of nose, and back of neck; hot head; < bending head forward, > bending head backward. Headache with tired neck. Itching is general; scalp, eyes, margins of lids; ears; nose. The nose is sore and has crusts in it. Lips dry and cracked. Many symptoms of sore throat. Rheumatic symptoms are > by motion. Heat and restlessness after retiring. Perspiration, often offensive. The symptoms are < in afternoon from to 6; < p.m.; < after retiring; < from warmth; < from motion; > by cold applications; from cold air; > from pressure. Berridge has recorded two cases in which Fago. was of service. In one it removed the following symptoms after aggravating the pain in the shoulder: On waking, dull, bruised pain in top of left shoulder, rather posteriorly, extending up neck, < on moving the part, going off after breakfast and returning later in the day; constipation; nausea a little before a.m., afterwards dull pain in left temple, feeling of heat all over. In the other case it permanently removed (after a week's aggravation), sinking in the stomach about or p.m., and temporarily removed a chronic diarrhoea about or a.m. The diarrhoea was increased later and was met by Laches. Hale mentions that there is a popular belief that indulgence in buckwheat cakes is a prolific cause of skin eruptions. He has found it curative in cases of eczema, erythema, and intertrigo." ],
