    "Characteristics" : [ "Manc. is a species of the Euphorbiaceae, and has all the virulent properties of the family in a high degree. It is one of the trees around which the upas legends have clustered. \"It is certain that the juice, which resembles pure white milk, does possess a considerable amount of acridity, and that some persons suffer great pain from incautiously handling it. . . . Perhaps its most dangerous property is that of causing blindness, if by chance the least drop of the milk, or smoke of the burning wood, comes in contact with the eyes. Dr. Seeman states that at Veraguas some of the ship's carpenters were blinded for several days by the juice getting into their eyes while cutting down Manchineel trees; while he himself suffered from temporary loss of sight from merely gathering specimens; and that the same accident happened to a boat's crew from making a fire. Salt water is said to be an efficacious remedy\" (Treas. of Bot.). Manc. was introduced into homoeopathy by Bute, who proved it. It was also proved by Mure and Ackermann. The symptoms induced were very intense. Burning was experienced in all parts, vesication and ulceration of the skin and mucous membranes. Head, eyes, throat, abdomen and rectum were the parts most affected. A leading feature of many symptoms was < by drinking cold water. Cough < from drinking water. There is general > from heat when lying down; but warmth of stove < headache; and there is inclination to uncover. Cough is < at night. Among peculiar sensations are: Head feels as, if bruised; or as if it had been exposed to the sun. Ears as if closed.", "Electric thrusts in upper part of throat. As if flames rising from stomach. As if stomach drew together in a lump and then suddenly opened. Head as if hollow; as if lying on something hard. As if something alive in stomach. Med. Cent. (ii. 112) quotes from Revist. Omeop. the case of a lady who for several years was possessed with the fixed idea that she would become insane. She had become a wife and mother, but still the idea possessed her. Happening to see in Puhlmann's Therapeutics that Manc. has \"fear of getting crazy, \", she took Manc. and was permanently cured." ],
