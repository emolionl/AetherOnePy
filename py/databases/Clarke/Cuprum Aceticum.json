    "Clinical" : [ "Angina pectoris. Apoplexy. Brain, affections of. Brow ague. Cerebro-spinal meningitis. Cholera Asiatica. Chorea. Croup. Diarrhoea. Eruptions. Erysipelas. Hallucinations. Hydrocephalus. Mania. Measles. Paralyses. Scarlatina. Small-pox. Strabismus. Tapeworm. Uraemia. Whooping-cough." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Cupr. acet. produces the leading features of Cupr. met.", "cramps, griping pains, spasms, paralytic affections, and convulsions. Attacks come on suddenly and periodically. It corresponds to the results of repelled eruptions. Dr. Burnett has cured with it a case of left-sided brow ague of many years' standing. He used Rhademacher's Tincture of Copper. The pain was described as boring, screwing and was spoken of by the patient as \"awful.\" Dr. Burnett is unable to say whether the cure was strictly homoeopathic or \"whether the Cuprum acted on the basis of the Paracelsic Universalia of which it is one.\" A man, was cured with Cupr. ac. trit. of a tonic spasm of the toes of the right foot, very painful, lasting for hours, brought on by friction, standing on cold floors, &c. There was no traceable cause, and no other derangement of health. Complete cure in five days, after months of previous suffering (H. R., ii. 71). Petroz recommended its use in small-pox and verified his induction in practice. As pointed out by General Phelps (H. W., October, 1896), the \"Crimson Cross Ointment\" used successfully by Fielden in the Gloucester epidemic of small-pox owes its virtues to the Cupr. acet. which it contains. In epilepsy the aura begins in the knees and ascends to hypogastrium, when patient becomes insensible. The symptoms are < by heat and by motion. The patient frequently changes, posture. It is suited to the carbo-nitrogenous constitution." ],
