    "Clinical" : [ "Urine, fetid." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Tropaeolum is a native of Peru. It was called \"Cress\" and \"Nasturtium\" because the taste of the leaves was considered like the taste of cress, and they have been used like cress in salads. The seeds make pickles, and are used as a substitute for capers. A patient to whom Cooper gave Trop. noted that it made the urine extremely fetid in smell. On this keynote Cooper has relieved several cases of urinary difficulty, giving single doses of the O tincture." ]
