    "Characteristics" : [ "Paris betrays its relation to the Lilies and Arums in the symptoms of irritation which it causes in mucous membranes and skin with burning sensations and cramps. The Treasury of Botany says of Paris that the leaves and stems were \"formerly used in medicine, the juice of the berry, though considered poisonous, has been employed in curing inflammation of the eyes.\" The provings made by Hahnemann, Stapf, and others, bring out a very marked and characteristic action on the eyes, and develop some of the keynote symptoms of the drug. One of these is a sensation of expansion and consequent tension. The head feels as if distended and the scalp too tight. The eyes feel as if much too large for their sockets; as if they were projecting and were being drawn tightly backward by a string to the middle of the brain. Paris is one of the drugs which are credited with producing garrulity, vivacity with love of prattling, like tea. A case of loquacious insanity cured with Paris was recorded by B. Nath Banerjee (Calc. J. of Med., xii. 60). It brings out many of the leading symptoms of Paris, which I have put in italics. Mrs. B., suddenly became loquacious and insane. After a month of Kavirajee treatment without benefit she came under Banerjee's care, October A year before, the last of her five children, a grownup son, died, and she could not be consoled, and gradually became morose and dull. She ceased to menstruate in February, but had no uterine troubles or any other illness previous to the present. The symptoms were: Loquacity, but not continuous. Every three or four days, if interfered with, maniacal attacks lasting about half an hour. At times foolish behaviour. With difficulty Banerjee obtained the following symptoms from the patient: Vertigo, and whenever she thinks of her lost son, severe headache, the vertex being sensitive to touch. When telling these symptoms, suddenly her looks became wandering, and her eyes appeared as if protruding from their sockets. She could not relish her food because everything, especially fish, smell putrid. Whole body painful, especially when touched. She complained of a ball lodging in the throat and giving her trouble, with burning. Acidity and badly smelling diarrhoea. A peculiar feeling of coldness of right side of the body while the left side was hot. All symptoms < in evening and on motion. Ign. and later was given without any effect. Paris acted promptly, and on the third day the patient assured the doctor that she was quite well. The remedy was not repeated and the cure held good. Paris is in general a left-side remedy, but it has coldness of the right side, whilst the left side is natural or hot. I cured with Paris \"numb feeling of left side of head.\" Numbness affects the upper limbs. The left arm is paralysed, feels stiff, and fingers contracted. \"Numbness and prickling in left hand\" was removed in a case of spinal affection. \"Fingers often feel as if asleep; objects seem rough to touch.\" This disorder of the sense of touch is a marked symptom. And at the same time there is great sensitiveness of the surface. The characteristic mucous secretions are green and tenacious. The diarrhoeic stools smell like putrid meat. There is great sensitiveness to offensive odours; also imaginary bad smells: milk and bread smell like putrid meat. The eyes give out a fetid, ulcer-like smell. Paris has \"hunger soon after a meal, \", which is the same thing as the \"sinking of the antipsorics, and of the Hellebores, Veratrums, &c. Peculiar sensations are: As if scalp were contracted and bones scraped sore. As if a thread were drawn tightly through eye to middle of head. As if head were puffed up, and temples and eyes were pressed out; as if distended the size of a bucket and the walls were too thin. Eyes as if too large; projecting; as if pulled into head by a thread drawn through eyeball; as if he could not open eyes. Ear as if forced apart by a wedge; as if pressed out or torn out; as if a burning heat was rushing out of ears. As though face were drawn to root of nose then back towards occiput as if by a string. Tongue feels too large. Ball in throat. Throat constricted. Stone in stomach. As if internal parts contracted. Heavy load on nape. Fingers as if asleep; dead. All joints as if broken, swelled or dislocated at every motion. Hot stitches in left malar bones. Acidity, sour saliva. The symptoms are < by touch. The scalp is very sensitive to touch. Pressure on a sore spot on head = cries. Pressure with the hand > pressive pain in head. Motion < rest >. Sitting = stitches in coccyx; burning in orifice of urethra vertigo. < From mental exertion; thinking. All symptoms < evening. Tenacious expectoration < morning. Dull pain in neck > in open air. Smoking tobacco = headache. < After eating (hiccough). > By eructations." ],
