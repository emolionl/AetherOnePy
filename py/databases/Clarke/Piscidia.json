    "Sleep" : [ "\"A sleep the most profound I ever experienced, arrested me so suddenly that I remained motionless the whole night with the uncorked vial in one hand, and the glass out of which I had taken the dose in the other, until the sun was high above the horizon, a space of twelve hours, when I first returned to consciousness, free from every pain or ache, and without any of the unpleasant sensations which invariably succeed an overdose of Opium\"" ],
    "Fever" : [ "\"Violent sensation of heat generally, increasing in intensity; the sensation of burning gradually extended to the surface, and while I was considering what antidote I ought to employ, a profuse diaphoresis burst out from every pore.\"" ]
