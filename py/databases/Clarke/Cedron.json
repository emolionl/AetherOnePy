    "Characteristics" : [ "Petroz and Teste introduced Cedr. into homoeopathic practice, having received the seed from Panama, with an account of its powers of entrusting snake-bite when chewed immediately after being bitten; and also of its traditional reputation in intermittent fevers. Hellert was bitten by a coral snake. \"During the few seconds which it took him to take the antidote out of the little bag which he wore suspended round his neck, he was siezed with violent pains at the heart and throat; but he had scarcely chewed and swallowed a small portion of Cedron, of the size of a small bean, when the pain ceased as by magic. An oppression and general prostration remained. He chewed another portion of the same fruit, and applied it to the wound externally, and in another quarter of an hour all he felt was a slight colic, which disappeared after eating a little. This colic was followed almost immediately by a copious evacuation of a substance that looked like curdled milk, white, with a slightly yellowish tint\" (Teste). Other cases were reported. The great characteristic of Cedron is a clock-like periodicity in the recurrence of the symptoms; accurately periodic neuralgias; intermittent fever commencing the same hour every day or every other day. In fever there is: Red face in hot stage; thirst with desire for warm drinks. Profuse perspiration. \"Excitement before chill\" is peculiar to Cedr. Fevers of low, marshy regions in warm seasons and tropical countries. General debility, languor, and fainting. Malaise. Trembling. Complaints after coition (chorea in women; neuralgia in men). Epileptiform convulsions during catamenia. Swollen sensations; numbness of whole body. Adapted to persons of a voluptuous disposition, and of an excitable nervous temperament; especially to females. < After sleep; lying down; night; (objects appear red at night, yellow by day); in open air; before a storm; chills in persons returned from tropical climates. > Standing erect.", "Halbert relates a case of malarial fever in a soldier. Chills and fever were clock-like in regularity of recurrence. Liver and spleen were much enlarged. Anaemia was extreme; and there was this additional peculiarity: intermittent gastralgia occurring with the febrile crises. In conjunction with these conditions there was a manifestation of choreic symptoms, involving face and shoulders mostly, the twitchings being troublesome in the interfebrile state; often there were debilitating hysterical spasms; the heart became irritable and sometimes irregular. After other remedies had failed to make any impression, Cedr. cured in three weeks, the improvement setting in immediately. Rapidity of action appears to be a characteristic as with Bell. The great predominance of nervous symptoms will be evident in the symptoms of Cedr., also the strong sexual excitement it causes. Numbness; enlarged sensation; malaise; sensation as if paralysed. A large number of symptoms appear on l. side, but r. side of head, face, r. elbow, and r. deltoid are affected." ],
