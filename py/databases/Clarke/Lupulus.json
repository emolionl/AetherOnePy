    "Characteristics" : [ "Lupulus has had a somewhat extensive proving, to the symptoms of which have been added the effects of working with hops and of sleeping in rooms where hops were stored. The \"hop-pillow\" remedy for sleeplessness is well known; and this sleep-provoking effect passes into delirium and stupefaction. In a child of twelve, who remained several days in a room where hops were being picked, there was: Frequent starting up from deep sleep with violent delirium, from which he could only be aroused with great difficulty, when he recognised the bystanders, but immediately fell backward into stupor. It was months before he recovered. The effects which remained were: Dilated pupils; mental indolence; unsteady movements; erythema. Among other symptoms of Lupulus are: Burning in urethra during urination. Nausea and vomiting. Turning sensation in stomach. Fermenting in abdomen. Twitching of tendons. Faintness. > In open air." ],
