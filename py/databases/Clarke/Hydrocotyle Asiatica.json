    "Characteristics" : [ "Hydrocot. has been long known as an Indian remedy. Boileau was the first to use it as a remedy in leprosy. It has been tested pathogenetically and clinically, and its place has been fairly well defined. The skin and the female generative organs are the chief seats of the drug's action; though the liver, the nerves, and the mucous membranes are also powerfully acted upon. A great variety of skin affections have been cured with it; acne, eczema, pemphigus, lupus, copper-coloured eruption; papular eruption on face; intolerable itching in various places. Auduit (H. R., ix. 434) cured this case: Girl, weak and sickly-looking, since childhood troubled with glandular swellings, for eight years had lupus exedens of nose. (Her mother had coppery eruption on face.) On right of nose was a button the size of a sixpence covered with a thick crust covering yellow pus mixed with blood. Margins irregular and livid. Five other buttons size of lentils near root of nose both sides. Hydroc. was given in O, and 18th potencies in succession, with intermissions, and completely cured in five months. Other indications are: Stomatitis, aphthous and syphilitic. Irritation of the neck of the bladder; increased secretion of urine. Heat and itching in vagina. Weight in uterus. Granular ulceration. Hydrocotyle acts on the male sexual organs also, causing weight in the \"male uterus, \", the prostate gland. Gouty and rheumatic disorders. Affections of the trigeminus nerve. Bruised feeling in all the muscles. A patient of mine who was taking Hydroc. for eczema with advantage complained of persistent dreaming all the time he was asleep; and an unpleasant mouth on waking in the morning." ],
