    "Characteristics" : [ "The American Pulsatilla approaches more nearly to P. vulgaris than to P. nig. in its botanical characters. It flourishes especially in the dry and sandy bluffs which form the bed of the Mississippi. The flower is pale purplish. \"The odour of the dried plant is rather faint, being slightly camphoraceous, the taste of the dried flowers simply sweetish and herbaceous, that of the leaves more astringent with very slight acrimony. The taste and to some extent the odour of the fresh plant are both acrid and irritating\" (Hale). A. W. Miller, a pharmaceutist (referred to by Hale), analysed P. nutt. The extracted substances had an acrid, almost caustic taste, and well-marked camphoraceous odour. When volatilised they produced an irritating, pungent vapour, affecting the eyes and causing sneezing. The analysis revealed the following constituents: (1) Organic", "Grape-sugar, gum, resin, an alkaloid and anemonic acid. (2) Inorganic", "Sulphate of potash, carbonate of potash, chlorate of potassium, carbonate of lime, magnesia, and \"a proto-salt of iron, \", Dr. W. H. Miller (brother of A. W. M.), an allopathist, claimed to have used P. nutt. with success in many chronic eye affections, particularly catarrh, amaurosis, and corneal opacities, cutaneous eruptions, and secondary syphilis. Hale instituted the first homoeopathic research, and Burt was the first prover. The symptoms have a strong resemblance to those of P. nig., and cases cured with P. nutt. are mostly such as would be amenable to P. nig. A patient of mine was incidentally cured of a tendency to catch colds by taking P. nutt. for some weeks as a prophylactic against measles. Burnett cured with it a case of deafness and oedema of left upper eyelid. The proving showed a powerful effect on the menstrual function, and Hale reports many cures of retentio mensium: (1) A young lady, formerly subject to retardation of menses, had: Constant chilliness, cold hands and feet, loss of appetite, sour eructations, nausea after meals, hemicrania, toothache, melancholy, general malaria. Menses two weeks late; took a chill at the time they were due, when she had precursory symptoms; no symptoms of menses now. P. nutt. in water every two hours. After the first dose the menses came on and the constitutional symptoms cleared off. (2) Plethoric, usually healthy young woman, had menses delay two weeks. Continual severe headache, a heaviness and fulness, < moving or stooping; sight dim, complete blindness on stooping or rising suddenly; weight in uterine region severe aching extending to back, < evening. Hands and feet cold; weakness in lower limbs. Act. r. failed to relieve. P. nutt. 1x, drops every three hours, brought speedy improvement. Next day menses came on profusely but without pain, two days before the expiration of the eighth week. The Puls. flying pains were very noticeable in the proving. Hale reports this case: Strong, healthy-looking man had wandering rheumatic pains chiefly in dorsum of right foot, loins, thighs, chest, arms, head. The head pain was a dull, heavy pressure in vertex, nearly constant, with occasional sharp pains. Some fever but no local inflammation of joints or muscles. Urine scanty, depositing lithates. Acidity of stomach. Appetite good. Bowels normal. P. nutt. 1x cured in three days. Some Peculiar Symptoms are: Home-sick feeling. Trembling weakness, weariness, heaviness. Snapping noise in ears. Fidgety feet. Colic before and after stool. Colic after eating a pear. Stiffness of fingers. Hands hot and dry (a constant symptom). The symptoms are < coming in from open air; after eating; eating a pear; at night; by warmth; by reading; on urinating; on walking. > Walking in open air; rubbing with flesh-brush; scratching." ],
