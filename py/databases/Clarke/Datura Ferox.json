    "Clinical" : [ "Delirium. Mania." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Poisoning with this drug causes raving madness. A girl who ate half an unripe fruit manifested the following: Completely out of her mind in a quarter of an hour, dizzy, sleepy; slept with eyes open; if disturbed, sprang up raving and uttered unintelligible words; if one sang she began to dance in the Javanese fashion. This symptom may prove a keynote in certain cases of mental alienation. Dryness of mouth was also noted in this case, as with Bell. and other Solanaceae." ]
