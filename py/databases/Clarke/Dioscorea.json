    "Characteristics" : [ "Burt, who made a heroic proving of this remedy, says: \"The grand sphere for the use of Dioscorea is among neuroses of the bowels and stomach; where the coeliac and umbilical plexuses are in a state of great hyperaesthesia, the pain and spasm being unbearable.\" Hale considers as characteristic: \"A constant pain, aggravated at regular intervals by paroxysms of intense suffering.\" Any kind of colic or neuralgia with these characteristics may indicate Dioscor., which stands in the highest rank among stomach and abdominal remedies, with important actions in many other spheres. Dioscorea causes pain in the bowels; spasmodic; twisting; writhing; drawing; lancinating; pulsating; burning. Pains radiate upwards and downwards. Frequent sharp, darting pains from one part to another. Pains spread, especially from abdomen to distant parts. Great faintness at stomach. Morning diarrhoea. Pains < at meals; > moving about; cannot sit still. Seminal emissions (passive) with weakness of knees. According to Cushing's proving the primary effect of Diosc. was to cause strong-smelling perspiration of the genitals; constant excitement with strong and frequent erections day and night; amorous dreams with emissions. Afterwards came relaxed genitals, absence of desire, and emissions without erections. In the female sphere it has frequently cured dysmenorrhoea, uterine colic, and after-pains; also gastric disorders during pregnancy and the menses. J. B. Bell has pointed out how closely the throat symptoms of Dios. resemble the initial stage of a cold when it has attacked the fauces and before it has spread to the nose or chest. Peculiar sensations are: As if top of head was lifted off. As if temples were in a vice. As if head tied with a band (also neck). As if sticks, &c., in eyes; as if hot air streamed out of them. As if tongue burnt. As if a stone were in stomach. In small spot in abdomen sensation as if drawn forcibly upward and backward to spine. Diosc. resembles Coloc. in colicky pains, but differs in the Conditions: whilst Coloc. has > bending double and < by motion, Diosc. has > by stretching out and by moving about. Some of the symptoms of Diosc. are <, others are > by touch and pressure. Many symptoms appear, or are < in early morning from a.m. onwards; on awaking; a.m. (cough). Symptoms generally > in open air. Pains are remittent and paroxysmal. It is one of the first remedies in whitlow; and in biliary and renal colic. Suited to persons of feeble digestive powers, old or young, with flatulence after meals, in stomach or bowels, unattended with liver or bowel derangement, who from some excess in eating, or from fasting, or from some error in diet, as eating old cheese, or uncooked fruit, pastry, &c., especially if they are great tea-drinkers, may be suddenly seized with violent colic." ],
