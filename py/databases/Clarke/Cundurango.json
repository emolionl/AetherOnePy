    "Characteristics" : [ "Cundurango belongs to the \"Milk-weed\" family, and is thus related to Asclepias Syriaca, and Tuberosa, and also to Calotropis. The action of the latter in syphilitic conditions may be compared with the power of Cundurango over cancer. The Condor plant was introduced into medicine as a cancer remedy by Dr. Bliss, of Washington. Clotar Muller cured with it several cases of \"old, obstinate, foul-smelling, ichorous ulcers\"; one case of \"carcinoma of the lips, an unclean and sinuous ulcer.\" Burnett, who proved it, and whose symptoms were of a severe nature, observed that it produced \"a painful crack in the right corner of the mouth.\" These cracks he has seen produced in several patients who were taking the drug; and he has cured similar cracks with it. He regards them as a keynote indication, and has cured patients of tumours, some undoubtedly cancerous, who had that symptom as a concomitant. In his opinion Cundur. is antipsoric (Tumours of the Breast, p. 28). Dudgeon (H. W., xxiv. 543) has recorded a cure with Cundur. of an undoubted case of cancer of left breast in a woman of sixty-nine. The nipple was so retracted as to be invisible. A hard tumour the size of an egg on the outer side of the nipple was the centre of lancinating pains radiating from it, the whole breast being very tender to touch. The tumour increased steadily under Hydrast. and Phytolac., and was only checked temporarily by Conium. Under Cundur. it entirely disappeared. Cundurango has found its chief use as a cancer remedy, especially in cancers originating in epithelial structures. Rhagades at muco-cutaneous orifices and warty excrescences are a leading indication for it. Cutting, stinging, burning, tingling, constrictive, and piercing pains are complained of. The skin manifests much of the action of the remedy: blotches; eczema; pimples; pustules; indolent ulcers; lupus; varicose ulcers; syphilitic affections; epithelioma, and scirrhus. Burnett considers it has a very strong affinity for the tongue. He cured with it a jagged ulcer of the tongue (doubtful whether cancerous or syphilitic); tongue and lips red. One prover had a slight creeping pain along periosteum of right humerus; and I observed \"a creeping sensation up the back, and headache in right temple\" in a patient taking it in the 1x tincture. An old-school authority, Dr. Guyvenot (Bull. Gen. de Therap. No. 1890) credits Condurangin with causing a \"veritable locomotor ataxia.\" It appears late, and he thinks it is due to the formation of some toxic substance by the splitting up of the alkaloid in the organism." ],
