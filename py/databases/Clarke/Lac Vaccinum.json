    "Characteristics" : [ "Lac vac. was proved by J, C. Boardman, of Trenton, New jersey (H. W., xix. 402). Swan's 200th potency was used. I have given the symptoms in the Schema. To these might be added the effects of milk on persons intolerant of it. The headaches, biliousness, and constipation frequently induced by milk are well known. The headaches were well brought out in the proving. Milk frequently aggravates rheumatism; and Burnett has observed that children who drink much milk after their teeth are grown become very liable to colds. The keynote of Lac can. is alternation of sides; in Lac vac. the symptoms appeared both sides simultaneously. The great thirst and excessive flow of urine suggest diabetes. Swan gives a brief proving (H. P., ix. 252) and some cures. The cures were: (1) Short rheumatic pains in knee and ankles on walking; passing fetid flatus. (2) Fever at night followed by profuse sweat all over; the fever was preceded by chilly feeling, beginning at shoulders, then running up from feet to head; headache. (3) Flat white ulcers on tongue, sensitive, covered with white slimy mucus, extending to sides of cheeks. (4) Brown crusts, having greasy appearance, especially in corners of mouth, like \"butter-sores.\" (5) Fulness of head, as if too large and heavy. (6) Vertigo. (7) Eructations and passing of much flatus.", "The symptoms of Swan's proving (by Miss H. from the 1m. of Fincke) are included in the pathogenesis." ],
