    "Characteristics" : [ "Ptelea is the Greek name for the Elm, and was applied by Linnaeus to a genus of shrubs and small trees, natives of North America and Asia, and included in Xanthoxylaceae. In Canada the young green shoots of Pte. tri. are used as an anthelmintic in the form of an infusion. The fronds are bitter and aromatic, and have been used as a substitute for hops (Treas. of Bot.). One of the provers of Pte. confirmed its anthelmintic powers by \"a very copious expulsion of ascarides.\" The proving was very thorough and extensive, and T. Nichol, Burt, and Cowperthwaite were among the provers. A very marked action was produced on the liver, and Nichol, one of the provers, values it highly (says Hale) in \"hepatic difficulties, and in those erysipelatous and urticarious eruptions that are so often concomitant with affections of the liver.\" Hale says it has not the violent action of Pod. or Ir. v., but \"a slow, pervading\" action, and causes chronic ailments. He has found it useful in \"bilious headache, dyspepsia, gastralgia, congestion of the liver, chronic hepatitis, and chronic erysipelas.\" Others have used it in chronic rheumatism, dysentery, and constipation, Hale says the oily constituent of Pte. resembles Turpentine; and one of the most marked symptoms of the proving is: \"Pressure as from a stone in pit of stomach, \", recalling Abies n. and the conifers. In the proving the liver was swollen and tender, but there was > lying on right side, and < lying on left. [H. K. Leonard (H. R., xiii. 468) cured a seemingly hopeless case with Pte. 1x on this symptom: Weight, aching distress, dull pain in hepatic region, > lying on right side; turning on left = a dragging as if liver pulling on its ligaments.] The \"dull, muddled head\" is another liver symptom. J. Preston (B. J. H., xlii. 71) cured with Pte. a case of jaundice following gall-stones, with great emaciation.", "Aching distress; general aching and soreness; malaise. A number of alternating symptoms were noted. Nervous pains alternating from left arm to left eye and temple. Liveliness alternates with sadness. As gastric symptoms improved difficulty of breathing came on. There is the ravenous hunger of the antipsorics; empty sensations in oesophagus, in stomach. Sensitive to light, sound, to open air. Enlarged feelings were noted: head feels large, fingers feel numb, and large and clumsy. Headache with hunger, especially on awaking, may prove a keynote. Right (liver) side most affected. The symptoms are < in hot room; > in cold air. < After sleep; on awaking. After eating, feeling of liveliness. After breakfast: distress in stomach, headache and hunger >; one. hour after, <. > After eating acid things. < From cheese; butter; pudding. General < after eating. > Morning and evening; < afternoon. < Lying down; lying l. side; > lying r. side. < Walking; speaking; mental exertion; moving eyes; raising eyebrows, before, during, and after stool. Headache > after stool. Straining at stool < vertigo. Coughing = feeling as if head would burst." ],
