    "Characteristics" : [ "Our knowledge of this remedy is derived from the ill effects of eating the nuts; among which are dread of liquids and salivation. It is this which has suggested its use in hydrophobia. In addition, trembling, convulsions with periodic spasms, stiffness and coldness have been observed, pointing to the same kind of nerve irritation as is caused by the poison of rabies. Swelling of the mouth and headache were noted in one case. In some instances death has resulted from the effects of the nuts." ],
