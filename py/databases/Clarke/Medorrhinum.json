    "Characteristics" : [ "Medorrh. is one of the most important of the nosodes. The constitutional nature of the gonorrhoea poison has within recent years been recognised in the old school as well as the new. Noegerath of New York and Angus Macdonald in this country have pointed out a causal connection between post-partum pelvic cellulitis and latent gonorrhoea in the husband. Macdonald published several fatal cases. The effects of the poison, constitutional or acute, may be taken as data for homoeopathic prescriptions; but the virus has had an extensive proving in the potencies, and the symptoms there recorded have been largely verified in practice. The nosodes may be used according to their indications in exactly the same way as other homoeopathic remedies, and not merely for manifestations of the disease from which they are derived. At the same time, a knowledge of the origin of obscure disorders, especially if hereditary, will often give the clue to the remedy required. Deschere published a case in point: Miss X., had chronic blepharitis since eleven. Her suffering was intense. Light, especially gas-light, was intolerable, and this prevented her from going into society. She could not read in the evening, and in the morning the lids would be closed, and she suffered much on getting them separated. There was much discharge. Before coming under Deschere she had been under strict homoeopathic treatment all the time. Deschere remembered treating her father for gonorrhoea before his marriage, and he suspected the taint had reappeared in this form. Medorrh. was given in high potency, single doses repeated as the effect of each wore off, and she was entirely cured. A case of favus which had resisted all the external applications that allopaths could devise, and which had such an appalling odour that the patient, a little boy, had to be isolated from the family, was traced by Skinner to the same hereditary cause and cured with Medorrh. 1m. Many cases of stunted growth and arrested development in children are due to latent gonorrhoea and syphilis, and unless this factor is discerned and taken into consideration in prescribing, no great good will be achieved. I have cured on this hypothesis extremely offensive body odours in children with Medorrh. One important point in distinguishing between the sycotic or gonorrhoeal taint and that of syphilis is in the time aggravation, and consequently in the indications for this. Syph. has < from sunset to sunrise, as also have all the great anti-syphilitic remedies. Medorrh. has < from sunrise to sunset; always brighter in evening, < in early morning hours. With Medorrh. there is intense nervous sensibility, especially to touch of garment or a lock of hair by any one not en rapport. Sensibility is exalted almost to clairvoyance. As if in a dream. Starting at slightest sound. Tremor; spasms. There is a state of collapse and a desire to be fanned. Among the Peculiar Sensations are: As of sticks in eyes, lids, and inner, canthi; as if cold wind blowing in eyes; as if upper lid had a cartilage in it. As if something crawling in ear and nose. Lump in stomach. Tumour right side of abdomen. As if left lung collapsed or paralysed. As if an abscess between left pectoralis major and minor muscles. As if blood was boiling hot in veins. As if all bones were out of joint.", "The pains seem to tighten the whole body, especially the thighs. There is scarcely a spot on the body that is not full of pain. Obstinate rheumatism. Sequelae of acute rheumatism. D. C. McLaren relates in Hahn. Advoc. (quoted Amer. Hom., xxii. 408) a case which illustrates the power and sphere of this nosode. A young French Canadian of delicate constitution, after working in a factory all winter, began coughing in spring and running down in health. He returned home and came under McLaren's care in May. The cough persisted and prostration increased, in spite of carefully selected remedies, and the patient took to his bed. It was then observed by McLaren that the cough and general condition was > from lying on the face. This, coupled with a knowledge of there being a syphilitic taint in the boy's parentage, suggested Medorrh., which was given. The next day a profuse gonorrhoeal discharge appeared, and the cough and all threatening symptoms promptly disappeared. Exposure to contagion had occurred several weeks before, but from lack of vitality the disease could not find its usual expression and was endangering the patient's life. Ernest Nyssens (\"La Sycose de Hahnemann, \", Jour. Belge d'Hom, vi. 244) quotes some important observations by old-school authorities on constitutional gonorrhoea. Wertheim in a case of gonorrhoeal cystitis watched the entrance of the gonococcus into the blood stream. With the gonococcus taken from the blood of this patient he made cultures to the fifth generation. A youth who had never had venereal disease volunteered for inoculation with this. The subacute urethritis which resulted was so grave, and, in spite of all, became complicated so cruelly with cystitis, epididymitis, prostatitis, synovitis, and pleuro-pneumonia, that Wertheim asked whether the gonococcus did not redouble its virulence by passing into the blood. Louis Jullien and Louis Sibut (from whose paper Nyssens quotes the above) witnessed the following case in Saint Lazare hospital: Louisa M., entered the hospital June 8th with urethro-vaginitis, and was treated with tampons (tiges) of Ichthyol dissolved in glycerine (1 to 5). The urethritis ran a normal course till July 6th, when this condition was reported: The patient has had sufferings in the abdomen for a week, but has made no complaint. However, they became so acute the previous night that an injection of Morphia was given. Rectal temperature Tongue saburral. Right side abdominal pain. In spite of rigid contraction of the recti muscles there seemed to be a swelling deep down, but the observers were not certain it was not a swelling of the muscles themselves. Intestinal functions normal; rectum empty. An eruption of roseolous spots appeared on the body, abdomen, and chest, so exactly like those of typhoid that the possibility of this was discussed. There was also acute pain in muscle of right calf. This pain persisted the following day when the abdominal pains had disappeared. July 9.", "Right knee painful, swollen. At same time synovitis of left wrist, dorsal aspect, the tendons attacked being the extensor proprius of thumb and index. Temperature normal. July 10.", "Very few and slight traces of the eruption. Right arm the seat of acute lancinating pain, especially at the level of the deltoid \"V, \", deep down near the bone at the insertion of the tendon (probably a hygroma). On examining the tendo Achillis, pain at the level of the left ankle, nothing to the right at the same level, but the pain is above all acute along the inner border of the right tibia, to five or six centimetres from the flat surface. This part is oedematous and painfully sensitive. Another painful spot in the abdomen is behind the right anterior superior iliac spine, and beside the navel (probably muscular). The urethral discharge contained abundant bacilli besides gonococci. Treatment by daily injection of one centigramme of Merc. cor. was commenced. The next day there was sharp fever, saburral tongue. The abdominal pains were frankly muscular. Trace of albumen in the urine. Next night there was delirium, and epistaxis in the morning. This case went on to recovery. Another case, also in a girl of seventeen, of phthisical history, and even complicated with syphilis, presented the same order of symptoms, along with epistaxis, haemoptysis, albuminuria, endocarditis with suffocative attacks and violent palpitations, ending in permanent disablement. These cases may be regarded as provings of Medorrh. from the homoeopathic stand-point.", "The rheumatic symptoms are of extreme intensity, and Medorrh. will cure many cases where the symptoms correspond. I have cured many cases of dysmenia with it, following Burnett. Burnett cured with Medorrh. 1m: (1) A patient who had fits at every menstrual period, the fits coming on in the early morning. (2) A man who had clonic spasms, the legs suddenly shot up from the bed. (3) A case of right wrist rheumatism. (4) Polypi having their origin in a chronic suppurating discharge. (He regards Medorrh. as \"the mother of pus and catarrhs\"). (5) Masturbation in children. (6) Albuminuria when the urine contains some mucus as well. (7) Sycotic asthma, < to a.m. (8) Psoriasis palmaris. Gilbert (Trans. Amer. Inst., quoted H. R., xi. 71) traces rickets to hereditary gonorrhoea; there are often in these cases glandular enlargements, and the patient is > at seaside. In such cases he gives Medorrh. (When there is syphilitic paresis and the patient is > in the mountains, he gives Syph.). In acute bowel troubles in rickety children he finds Medorrh. of great value.", "Thomas Wildes (H. P., xii. 70) considers that favus and scald-head and ophthalmia tarsi simplex (margins scaly, scurfy, often angry red, falling of lashes) are due to suppressed gonorrhoea in one or both parents. The red, angry condition of skin may extend from face or scalp, down neck and back to perineum and genitals. (1) Girl, had been treated by many physicians with salves and ointments to the general impairment of her health. Face mottled with a profusion of red scurfy sores, eyelids involved and nearly denuded of lashes; hairy scalp one diffuse mass of thick yellow scabs, from beneath which oozed a highly offensive mixture of ichor and sebum. Passing down neck, back, perineum and involving genitals and pubes was a fiery red band as broad as the child's hand, oozing a pale yellow serum which caused the clothing to stick to the body. Wildes told the mother he could cure the case, but it would certainly get worse the first three months. This was not objected to. Medorrh. c.m. (Swan) was given, one dose on the tongue. The external appearance grew rapidly worse, but appetite, sleep, and general health steadily improved, and in nine months she was completely well. (2) Child, since infancy horribly disfigured with tinea capitis. Scalp a mass of dense scabs exuding fetid ichor, the only semblance of hair being a few distorted stumps ending in withered roots. One dose cured in a few months, and at the time of Wildes' writing patient was a healthy and extremely talented young lady and the possessor of a luxuriant head of chestnut hair. Wildes thinks that suppression of favus when derived from gonorrhoea in the father leads to hydrocephalus, capillary bronchitis, severe teething diarrhoeas, cholera infantum, &c.; if derived from the grandfather, suppression leads to consumption and lingering diseases. Fiery red rash developing about the anus in babies a few days old; constipation with hard, dry stools; when the nurses say \"baby's water scalds it terribly, \", the indications for Medorrh. are clear. Wildes regards the latent gonorrhoeal taint as the true explanation of many of the disease-manifestations included by Hahnemann under Psora. Burnett in a way confirms this, as he traces gout to a sycotic origin. Wildes regards Medorrh. too dangerous a remedy to give in acute cases whether of gonorrhoea, rheumatism, or scarlatina, on account of the intensity of the aggravation it is liable to cause; though single doses are often useful when there is a tendency to sinking in dangerous cases of cholera infantum. Among other diseases Wildes traces to the same source are: Vascular meningitis in infants and cerebro-spinal meningitis. In the former the efficacy of Medorrh. is doubtful, but in the latter it is very efficacious after Act. r. has allayed the first acute symptoms. In the convalescent stage Lyc. has been his chief remedy. He quotes from old-school authorities the following conditions traceable to latent gonorrhoea communicated from husband to wife: Ovarian tumours, oophoritis, salpingitis, metritis, parametritis, endometritis, and even peritonitis, ", "Medorrh., is the remedy in single doses, but it is rarely if ever to be given in the acute stages of a disease. In general motion <, rest >. Lying on face or stomach > cough. Stretching out <. Leaning head forward <. Leaning far back > constipation: can only pass stool so. (I cured with Medorrh. a most aggravated case of constipation on this indication. The patient said he was obliged to lean far back on the seat or he could not get rid of the stool. He was passing urine containing long white mucous shreds. Many years before he had had gonorrhoea.) There is great sensitiveness to draught of air; takes cold easily. At the same time there is great desire to be fanned. < In the sun; by warmth of bed; entering a warm room (cough). Salt-water bathing > sore throat and cold in head. Damp weather > pain in limbs. Craving for ice. Chronic rheumatism of joints is < inland, > near sea. The early morning < (especially to a.m.) is a leading characteristic of Medorrh. and all sycotics." ],
