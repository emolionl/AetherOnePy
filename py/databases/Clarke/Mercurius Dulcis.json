    "Characteristics" : [ "Merc. dulc. is responsible for a large amount of the mercurialisation of the past and for some of the present. As a comparatively mild and slow-acting form of mercurial, it has none of the corrosive effects of the perchloride, but it has all the power of the metal in it nevertheless, and it has had its own share of disasters. For constipation and any affection which could be ascribed to the liver, blue pill was at one time about the only recognised remedy. Some homoeopaths have adopted a modification of this by prescribing Merc. dulc. 1x in two- or three-grain doses as a direct purgative. But as Merc. dulc. has caused both constipation and diarrhoea, it is probable that the action is roughly homoeopathic. The Schema is made up for the most part of toxicological and clinical symptoms; though a proving of potencies has been made. It is especially scrofulous children who are liable to remittent bilious attacks who are benefited by Merc. dulc. The keynote of Merc. dulc., in this as in other complaints is pallor: \"pallid as a corpse, \", and with this a \"flabby bloatedness\" of appearance. Pale, scrofulous children who have swelling of cervical and other glands. Skin flabby and ill-nourished. Another leading feature of Merc. dulc. is inflammation with plastic exudation. I have seen Calomel in old-school practice rapidly resolve and cure a violent meningitis, with wild delirium, in a girl of five. In this case there was probably plastic exudation on the membranes. Plastic peritonitis. Gluing up of Eustachian tube with catarrh. Scrofulous inflammation in general and particularly of the eyes. Soreness round anus is a leading indication in many affections when it occurs as a concomitant." ],
