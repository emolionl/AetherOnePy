    "Characteristics" : [ "Whilst Mag. c. and Mag. sul. are recognised old-school remedies, I can find no mention of Mag. mur. or Mag. Phos. in modern text-books. Mag. m. first appeared in Hahnemann's Chronic Diseases. The general feature of Mag. c. appears in many symptoms, notably those of nervous disturbance and hysteria. The salt, says Guernsey, \"is found in many mineral waters, and in seawater. It has a very bitter taste, and is decomposed by heat.\" The note about the sea-water is important. Mag. m. is like Nat. mur., and Aq. mar. in the relation to seaside effects. Nat. m. is particularly indicated in constipation, \", biliousness, \", and generally disordered health, which appear as soon as the patient goes to the seaside. Mag. m. is indicated when excessive weakness is felt after a sea-bath. The chief Localities of its action are: Head; r. hypochondrium; inner region of liver; rectum and large intestine; bladder; uterus; heart; feet. It is especially suited to: Diseases of women; spasmodic and hysterical complaints complicated with uterine diseases. Headache at menstrual period in hysterical women. Women after suffering months or years from attacks of indigestion or biliousness. Enlargement and congestion of liver Puny, rickety children during dentition. Men with disordered livers; and sexual disorders. Teste, who places Mag. m. in his Ferrum group, says that Mag. m. and Mag. c. \"have been used for the cure of cachexia occasioned by long and painful diseases.\" He says he has seen Mag. m. produce great improvement in this case: \"Hydrarthrosis of left knee, with emaciation of left thigh, consequent on a wandering neuralgia, which, after having commenced in the form of cystitis with (non-venereal) discharge from urethra, had successively invaded the shoulder, left elbow, eyes, and lastly, knees, where it had become seated.\" A connection between liver disorder and nasal obstruction has often been traced, and Mag. m. has a large number of symptoms in both. The nasal symptoms have led to its successful use in ozaena. One case cured had redness, swelling and scaliness of nose, and sweat about the head and feet. Mag. m. is one of the leading remedies in foot-sweat. Burning in soles, evening, must put feet out of bed. In liver affections there is enlargement, sensitiveness < from touch, and < lying on r. side; tongue large, coated, indurated. It is especially suited to liver affections in children who are puny and rickety, and have eruptions about the eyes. The constipation of Mag. m. is very distinctive, and has led to the cure of many extremely obstinate cases. The characteristic stool is knotty and conglomerate, like sheep's. It may remain in this condition, or it may crumble at the anus. Painful urging before stool; burning at anus after. As well as intestinal atony, there is atony of bladder: urine can only be passed by bearing down with abdominal muscles. The hysterical symptoms are marked: spasms, fainting, globus. Bearing down in uterine region; uterine spasms. Menses black or pitch-like, accompanied by pains in back when walking, pains in thighs when sitting. Leucorrhoea after every stool or following uterine spasms. Hysterical headaches. Patient is anxious, restless, always < by mental exertion; during or after dinner seized with nausea, eructations, trembling and faint spells, > by eructations. Palpitation < when quiet, > moving about. Perversions of taste and smell are marked in Mag. m., and I have frequently restored with it loss of taste and smell after influenza. Among the Sensations of Mag. m. are: As if some one was reading after her. As if boiling water was on side of head. As if hair pulled. As if tongue burnt; mouth scalded. Stools as if burnt. The pains are mostly boring and spasmodic contractive pains; dragging down. There is much burning and heat. R. M. Skinner reports (Med. Adv., xxiv. 383) this case: A farmer had been treated allopathically three months for chills, which were checked, but the man did not feel well. Spleen very large, sensitive, felt heavy when he walked or rode. Constipated, goes three or four days without a stool. It was for this that he sought advice. Abdomen distended. hard, especially in ileo-caecal region. Cold on left side and a crawling feeling, like a cold snake. Beating in umbilical region as if his heart beat there. Mag. m. one dose on the tongue. At p.m. the bowels began to act and went on acting with the exception of one hour till a.m. He complained next morning that the medicine had \"almost killed him, \", and he looked thin and tired. No further medicine was given, and in ten days he had no complaint, and the spleen was normal in size and without tenderness. In a large proportion of Mag. m. cases the Conditions will give the leading indications. There is general hyperaesthesia and < by touch or pressure; but the head pains are > by hard pressure; eye pains > by pressure, and the menstrual pains > by pressing on back. There is great sensitiveness to cold and disposition to catch cold, > wrapping up head warmly; but the skin eruptions on face, head, and eyes are < in warm room; cough < in room. Most symptoms except headache are > in open air. Sea-bathing = bloody expectoration; great weakness. Rest <; motion > (this is especially marked and peculiar in reference to palpitation). < Lying down. Palpitation is > lying on left side. Liver symptoms < lying right side, < on side lain on. [Also lying on left side = sensation of something (liver) dragging to that side.] Rumination < while walking. < At meals (fainting). > By eructations (nausea and trembling). < After coitus (pain in testes and cords). Mental exertion <." ],
