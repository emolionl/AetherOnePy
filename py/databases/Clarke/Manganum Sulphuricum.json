    "Clinical" : [ "Bile, excess of. Gastritis. Liver, affections of; inflammation of. Toothache." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "\"This Salt of Manganese, \", says Cooper, \"deserves more attention than seems to be at present given to it. It has been proved to cause vomiting, paralysis without convulsions, and inflammation of the stomach and small intestines, as well as of the liver, spleen, and heart in animals, and C. G. Gmelin, who experimented with it, records also its property of causing such an extraordinary secretion of bile that nearly all the intestines were coloured yellow by it, and the large intestines had a wax-yellow colour communicated to them. Mr. Ure, acting on Dr. Pereira's suggestion, found it act on man as a purgative and cholagogue in doses of one to two drachms in half a pint of water. It has, however, caused vomiting and sweating as well as purgation (Pereira, Mat. Med., 4th ed., vol. i. p. 677), and is uncertain in its action (from an allopathic point of view). In one case of hepatic derangement where the stools were composed of large quantities of bile, Mang. sulph. 1x cured. The same preparation caused the following: Toothache, in a bad tooth, on right side, upper jaw; shooting darting extending up the whole side of face and head and corresponding side of neck and shoulder and side of chest; painful parts tender to touch; pain is driven away by applying a hot smoothing-iron to near the surface of skin. According to Rutherford, Mang. sulph. is a powerful intestinal, but a feeble hepatic stimulant.\"" ]
