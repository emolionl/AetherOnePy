    "Characteristics" : [ "The Meadow Parsnip is a common plant indigenous to the United States on the moist banks of streams and in open wet woods, where it flowers in June and July. Rafinesque speaks of it as vulnerary, antisyphilitic, and sudorific (Millspaugh). Marcy proved Ziz. on himself and some others, and symptoms of poisoning have been added. Exhilaration with increased physical strength was noted; but a slight amount of exercise caused fatigue. The spasms and convulsions of the Umbelliferae were elicited. The generative organs in both sexes were excited. Ziz. is indicated in uterine affections characterised by increased nervous and vascular excitement. The menses are profuse, and followed by acrid leucorrhoea. Burning, smarting backache. Spasmodic movements of face and limbs. Mind first exhilarated, then depressed, finally indifferent. The restlessness of Ziz. runs into chorea; and the chorea has this distinguishing feature, that the movements continue or are even < during sleep. Connected with the uterine congestion there is migraine, the region of the right eye being most affected. There was rush of blood to the head. Marcy considered Ziz. especially suitable in brain affections; catarrhal, asthmatic, and pleuritic diseases; in ovarian neuralgia. Among Peculiar Symptoms are: Surface of body paler than natural; white, puffy appearance of whole body. Laughs and weeps alternately. One cheek red. Craves acids and stimulants. The symptoms are: < By touch. Pressure = pain in intercostal muscles; on stomach = nausea and faintness. < Lying; stooping; motion; coughing." ],
