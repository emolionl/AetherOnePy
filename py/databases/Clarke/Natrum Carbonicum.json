    "Characteristics" : [ "Nat. carb. is the typical salt of the Natrum group. It was proved by Hahnemann, and is one of the antipsoric remedies of the Chronic Diseases. In old-school practice its chief uses are as an external application in solution to burns and eczema, as a douche in nasal or vaginal catarrh. Nat. c. forms the alkaline basis in most soaps, and most persons know by experience the effect of using soap with an excess of alkali. It almost burns off the superficial layers of the epidermis, and leaves the skin dry and cracked. The provings, whilst developing in Nat. c. a remedy of polychrest importance, confirms its irritating action, and show Nat. c. to be a true remedy for chapped hands and faces, rough, dry skins, eczema, herpes, warts and scrofulous conditions of skin. On the mucous membranes the effects are no less irritating. The whole alimentary tract from mouth to anus is irritated", "vesicles, ulcers, catarrh. In the eyes the irritation goes on to keratitis and ulceration of cornea. The nose is swollen and ulcerated, with a thick yellow or green offensive discharge. Thick, yellow, putrid leucorrhoea. The predominant mental condition of Nat. c. is one of profound sadness, depression, and melancholy; constantly occupied with sad thoughts; though there is also the opposite, great gaiety and talkativeness. The hypochondriacal mood is often an accompaniment of the condition of the digestive mucous membrane. The depression and irritability is < after a meal, the aggravation diminishing as digestion advances, \"as the food passes through the duodenum.\" Such patients, says Farrington, are decidedly averse to society, even that of their own family. The indigestion is < from vegetables and starchy foods. < From milk. The tongue has some characteristic symptoms, notably affection of the under surface and fraenum, and it is so heavy and unwieldy that the patient has difficulty in speaking. The common practice of taking Bicarbonate of Soda for indigestion and heartburn is founded on a true relationship (though Nat. c. is the Carbonate and not the Bi-carbonate), but the indiscriminate and excessive use of it only intensifies the trouble. The nearest analogue of Nat. c. in this and in the female sexual sphere is Sepia. The nervous system is strongly affected, and symptoms of hysteria appear. A leading note is < from exertion, mental or bodily. Great debility from any exertion; unsteady walk, any little obstruction on pavement = falling; or he falls without any apparent cause. There are contractions of muscles and tendons, and also relaxation of tissues. Ankle-joints are weak and burn. Twitching in muscles and limbs. I have cured with Nat. c. \"jerking of hands on going to sleep.\" Among the Peculiar Sensations are: As if head too large. As if forehead would burst. As if head would be drawn back. As if ears were closed up. As of a bubble bursting in ear. As if tip of tongue were cracked. Dryness of mouth as if caused by heat of breath. As if veins of right leg were bruised. Motion as from a foetus in uterus. Blisters on points of toes as if scalded. Emaciation, anaemia, bloating are prominent effects of Nat. c.; as also is swelling and induration of glands. Nat. c. is suited to: Light-haired people; persons of leuco-phlegmatic constitution with aversion to open air, and to exercise, mental or physical. Stitches go from within out. Right upper and left lower are particularly affected. A peculiar symptom of Nat. c. is \"discharge of mucus after an embrace\" in the woman; and sterility as a result. In Med. Adv., xviii. and are two cases in point, one cured by J. C. Guernsey and the other by W. Jefferson Guernsey. In both cases the woman complained that she \"could not retain the semen\" after the embrace. Some of the grand keynotes of the remedy are to be found in its modalities. Prominent among these are < from sun; heat; gaslight. < From mental exertion; from physical exertion or strain; from least effort. < From music. Nat. c. has great debility from heat of summer; from chronic effects of sunstroke, every spell of warm weather = headache. Headache from sun or working under gaslight. At the same time there is great aversion to cold air, < from draught of air, change of clothing, getting wet, drinking cold water, < damp weather, change of weather. < From storms. Nat. c. has extreme sensitiveness to electric changes. There is great thirst for cold water, but < on drinking it (stitches in spleen). < By rest; < lying on left side (palpitation; stitch in back to anus); < sitting. Moving >. Moving head = cracking in cervical vertebrae. Moving = profuse sweat. Most symptoms come on or are < in morning. \"Sinking\" to a.m. < On alternate days. < During full moon. Eating > sinking, < dyspepsia and hypochondriasis. < From milk; from vegetable diet; from cold drink when over-heated. > By pressure, rubbing, scratching, wiping with hand. > Boring into ears and nose with fingers." ],
