    "Characteristics" : [ "Pediculus belongs to the same class of remedies as Cimex and Trombidium. It was proved by Mure, who says that he thought that nature pointed to the Louse as a specific for hereditary psora, in which belief he was strengthened by the fact that Psorinum develops pediculosis in healthy persons, and he adds that he has found Pedic. one of the most useful agents in diseases of children. This is the only clinical observation I have met with in regard to the remedy. Five persons, took part in the proving, but no particulars are given as to the doses they took. All developed symptoms. Among these were: Eagerness and aptitude for study and work. One prover, a stammerer, had unusual fluency of words. Constriction of pharynx. Jerks and starts in evening when sitting or lying.
