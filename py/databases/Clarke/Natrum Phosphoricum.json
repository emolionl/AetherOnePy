    "Characteristics" : [ "As Nat. phos. is one of Schussler's introductions I will first quote what he has to say about it: \"Nat. phos. is contained in the blood-corpuscles, in the cells of the muscles, of the nerves and of the brain, as well as in the intercellular fluids. Through the presence of Nat. p. lactic acid is decomposed into carbonic acid and water. Nat. p. is able to bind to itself carbonic acid, receiving into itself two parts of carbonic acid for every volume of phosphoric acid. When it has thus bound the carbonic acid it conveys it to the lungs. The oxygen flowing into the lungs liberates the carbonic acid, which is only loosely attached to the Nat. p.; the carbonic acid is then exhaled and exchanged for oxygen, which is absorbed by the iron of the blood-corpuscles. Nat. p. is the remedy for those diseases which are caused by an excess of lactic acid. It therefore answers to the diseases of infants, who, having been fed to excess with milk and sugar, suffer from redundant acids. The symptoms in such cases are: Sour eructations, vomiting of sour, cheesy masses; yellowish-green, so-called hacked diarrhoeas; colic, spasms with acidity. Uric acid is dissolved in the blood by two factors, the warmth of the blood and Nat. p. If uric acid is deposited from its solution in the joints or near them, owing to a deficiency of Nat. p., or when it combines with the base of Carbonate of soda into urate of soda, which is insoluble, then there arises podagra or acute arthritic rheumatism. During an acute attack of podagra the secretion of uric acid in the urine is diminished by just so much as is retained of it in the diseased parts. Nat. p. also serves to saponify the fatty acids; it therefore cures those dyspeptic ailments which arise from eating fat food, or which are aggravated thereby.\"", "Nat. p. has been proved, chiefly in the attenuations, under Farrington's direction. Schussler's indications do not all appear in the provings, but I insert them in the Schema and distinguish them by (S). The correspondence is tolerably close. In the proving the nose-irritation and itching anus of the worm-condition was developed. Atony of bladder. Hair sensation on tongue. Tightness of muscles and tendons. Seminal emissions. Charles Mohr, who was one of the provers, relates in Amer. Med. Monthly (Oct., 1897) the effect it had on him and the use he made of it. After being under the influence of the drug some time (without knowing what it was) he had much itching at the ankle-joints, with an eczematous eruption. Fear, especially at night, that something would happen. Headache; some nausea; defect of vision, one pupil dilated. The symptoms had to be antidoted with Sepia. Two years after, Mohr had a patient with visional disturbance and headache, and when these were at their worst he had a sense of fear, < at night, and an eruption about the ankles which began with itching. Nat. p. 6x cured promptly. M. J. Luys (H. W., xxxiv. 477) has successfully overcome the morphia habit by subcutaneous injections of Nat. ph. with glycerine and water.", "The symptoms are < walking, especially up stairs.
