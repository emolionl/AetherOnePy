    "Characteristics" : [ "Sulfonal was at first regarded as one of the safest of hypnotics, but many cases of poisoning by medicinal doses have occurred, and my Schema is made up of reported effects produced on patients. The accounts will be found in recent numbers of H. W. Prominent symptoms were: Stupor. Headache, with noises in ears. Vomiting and diarrhoea. Urine retained, or secretion arrested; claret-coloured; containing albumen; porphyrin. Ataxic gait and diminished or abolished reflexes point to locomotor ataxy. Ascending paralysis has been observed. The heart is weak; fainting occurs; and death takes place by heart failure. Rashes have been noticed on the skin, purpuric, erythematous, &c. One man (H. W., xxxii. 174) observed uniform skin effects every time he took Sfo., more intense the larger the dose. This occurred from gr. v.: Patches of erythema appeared (1) first on inner side of first phalanx of right little finger; (2) next over proximal ends of metacarpal bones of left thumb and index; (3) on posterior surface of left forearm a little below elbow; (4) fourth on prepuce. The symptoms were > by cold douches." ],
