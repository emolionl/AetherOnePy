    "Characteristics" : [ "This is an unproved remedy, but clinical experience has revealed a specific relation to the manifestations of syphilis: Hunterian chancre; syphilitic nodes; falling of the hair; syphilitic and scrofulous ulcerations of scalp; syphilitic and non-syphilitic ulcerations of fauces", "all these have been reported cured by it. Hale also commends it in: Scrofulous dyscrasia; obstinate skin diseases; cachexia of intermittents with enlargement of liver and spleen. In massive doses it has cured, according to eclectic authorities: \"A derangement of the stomach, attended with profuse morbid secretion of mucus, there being always a coated tongue, with fetor of the breath, and loss of appetite and digestion.\" It is therefore indicated, as Hale remarks, in gastric catarrh, being an analogue, in this respect, of Hydrastis. It has not been used in the potencies; ten drops of the tincture four times a day has been a usual dose." ],
