    "Characteristics" : [ "This is another of the remedies introduced by Swan. The full pathogenesis appears in Med. Visitor, Aug., part having already appeared in H. W., xviii. 15l. The greatest number of the symptoms were experienced in the head and eyes, and many of these have been confirmed. Here is one from Swan: \"Terrible headache penetrating the left eyeball to centre of brain, with pain in left supra-orbital region extending through brain to right vertex\" (H. W., xviii. 429). Many eye cases are on record. Swan benefited this case: \"Pain in eyes back into head, extremely sharp, with a sensation as if the eyes extended back. Great photophobia: any continued glare causes the pain\" (H. W., xvii. 54). Berridge reports this case: \"Mr. H., Left eye inflamed three weeks; deep red; photophobia; on left segment of cornea an ulcer. For three nights pain like a knife running from left eye to left occiput, on lying down, especially on left side. Burning in left temple, near eye, < at night. Lac. fel. 40m. (Fincke) every four hours. Eye was better next day, and steadily got well. The pain ceased first.\" Berridge remarks that \"< lying on left side\" has been verified by him in another case (Lach. has < lying on painful side; Zinc. < lying on unpainful side", "H. P., vi. 376). One of the provers took 17th, and afterwards 1m. (Fincke) potency. Another prover took the 200th. Among the verified symptoms are: Morbid conscientiousness; heaviness in forehead; scalded sensation on tongue; absence of appetite. The eye affections are mostly accompanied by shooting pains from eye backwards. Styes were present in some cases. (In the Schema cured symptoms are bracketed or have the name of the disease in which they occurred appended in brackets.)" ],
