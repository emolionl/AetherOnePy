    "Characteristics" : [ "Inula is a \"perennial plant with a stem from three to four feet high; large saw-toothed leaves tapering to a stalk; and large heads of yellow flowers. The root has an aromatic camphor-like taste, due to the presence of a crystalline substance called Helenin, allied in chemical constitution to Kreosote. It also contains a quantity of starchy material, called Inulin, which differs from ordinary starch in being coloured yellow by Iodine. Elecampane was formerly much used as an aromatic tonic, and as a stimulant of all the secreting organs, likewise in coughs, dyspepsia, \", &c. This quotation from the Treasury of Botany well sums up the chemistry and ancient medical history of the plant as handed down from the time of Dioscorides. Ben Jonson refers to it in one of his poems. A popular tradition credits it with the cure of facial erysipelas, and certain symptoms of the face in the provings seem to confirm this. The homoeopathic knowledge of it is due to. Fischer, who proved the root-juice. Clinical experience has confirmed and added to the symptom list. The old reputation of the remedy in coughs is confirmed: \"Violent tickling in larynx, producing dry cough, < lying-down, < at night; larynx painful, \", also \"dry cough, with constant tickling in throat-pit, difficult breathing and sensation as if hoarseness would occur.\" A very pronounced effect was observed in the pelvic organs; pressing and dragging towards the rectum and genitals, headache and labour-like pains. Inula is one of the remedies which has sensation as of something alive moving about internally; also twisting as of a ball in umbilical region; as if a substance would come out of rectum and genitals. Another peculiar sensation is: as though some one was poking him with a finger in various parts of the body, especially in diaphragm, so painful he awoke with clenched teeth. Sticking pains as with pins or a knife are numerous. The majority of the symptoms occurred on the right side. The symptoms are < at night; < lying down (except the uterine pain, which compels patient to remain lying); < by motion; after eating." ],
