    "Characteristics" : [ "Tromb. is \"a parasite found singly or in groups upon the common house-fly, of a bright red colour, nearly circular in shape. The alcoholic tincture, a brilliant orange in colour, was prepared from specimens, about in number, collected in Frankfort, Philadelphia, in September, The provings, under the supervision of Hering, were made by Harvey, Head, J. F. R., and Bancroft, the potencies used 3x, 6x, and 30\" (Hering, Guiding Symptoms). The grand keynote of Tromb. is \"< by eating or drinking.\" The symptom may be in the nose, teeth, or tonsils, this modality is characteristic. On this indication I have cured some of the worst cases of diarrhoea; and also intestinal pains coming on when the patient eats or drinks. I have used a 10m preparation of Fincke's given me by Skinner. A comprehensive keynote in diarrhoea and dysentery is: \"Much pain before and after stool; stool only after eating.\" Tromb. has cured dysentery with brown, thin, bloody stools and tenesmus. Congested liver with urgent, loose stools on rising from bed; during stool, sharp pain in left side, shooting downward.\" Skin symptoms were prominent, especially itching of scalp and in whiskers. Fainting on rising up. Restlessness, inability to keep quiet. Peculiar Sensations are: As if there were no weight in head; lightness. As from incarcerated flatus in abdomen. As if excoriated after tenesmus. As if everything were coming out of anus. As if hot air blowing over lower abdomen and thigh. As if abdomen needed support. As if three toes on left foot would be twisted off. As if her breath were leaving her. The symptoms are: < By touch (pain in liver). < By pressure (pain in abdomen). Lying down: < toothache; prevents fainting. Swallowing, or blowing Dose = shooting in right ear. < Shaking head. Reading aloud = toothache. Rising up = fainting. Walking < pain in head; = pain in hip-joint (which is, however, > after a few steps). < Moving. Warm drink > toothache. Open air > coryza. Cold air < toothache. Cold bath < pain in abdomen. < Eating or drinking. < After stool." ],
