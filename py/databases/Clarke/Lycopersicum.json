    "Characteristics" : [ "There is a popular impression that eating Tomatoes is a cause of cancer. The impression is not strong enough to prevent the universal use of them, and I have been unable to discover any basis for the idea. Cooper gave Lycopers. in a case of rodent ulcer and caused sharp pain and temporary spread of the disease. Cooper commends the use of them in cases of obesity. I know of one instance in which the slightest indulgence in them brings on an attack of gout. When raw they require mustard or other condiment, being cold to the stomach. Gross made a proving of Lycopers. It caused sticking and pressing pains; a sense of paralysis; peevishness and loss of memory; pressing and boring pains in head; stopped catarrh. Some women cannot eat tomatoes without getting backache, leucorrhoea, or metrorrhagia. In Gross's proving the headache was < in evening, she was obliged to rise in the night to urinate. The mind symptoms were <, and the headache > by leaning the head against something. Dr. Herbert H. Roberts, of Derby, Conn., has published (N. A. J. H., October, 1900) provings made by himself, two with the 3x and two with the 30x tinctures. \"The original tincture was made from the thoroughly ripened fruit, great pains being taken to thoroughly macerate the seeds as well as the pulp.\" Dr. Roberts' symptoms seem to me of great importance. They will be found marked \"(R.)\" in the Schema. The rheumatic and congestive symptoms were mostly produced by the 3x, the nervous symptoms mostly by the 30x. Roberts remarks that the natives of Mexico and California eat quantities of the ripe fruit to prevent rheumatism. Very decided rheumatic pains were developed both by Gross and Roberts. The right deltoid was very markedly affected, and should make Lycopers. a companion to Sang. in shoulder pains. The headaches were very intense and characteristic, in some great soreness remained after the pain had gone. This is a not uncommon feature; and neuralgic headaches with this concomitant or sequela should call Lycopers. to mind. A coryza < out of doors should make Lycopers. a useful alternative to Cepa, which has > out of doors. < By noise. < By motion. (Gross's rheumatic pains were bad both by rest and motion.) The headache in one instance was completely > by tobacco smoke. > In warm room. > By external heat. Right side principally affected, symptoms proceed from right to left, but left side is not so severely affected. Polyuria was a feature of both provings, and with the great thirst should give Lycopers. a place in diabetes. Dark-complexioned people seem to be suited to its action from two cases recorded by Roberts. (1) Widow, dark complexion, large, stout, grey eyes. Sudden attack of grip. Very severe aching pains all over, up and down back, limbs, head. Beating, throbbing in head, beginning in occiput, spreading all over head, settling with great violence in temples. Excruciating pain back of eyes and in balls as if they would burst with the pressure. Light causes pain. Delirium. Severe, deep, racking cough. Thirst for large quantities. Pupils contracted. Lycopers. 3x every hour, cleared away the fever and acute symptoms by the following morning, and rapidly cured the remaining cough. (2) Man, dark complexion, black hair and eyes, tall, thick-set. Severe bursting, throbbing pain beginning in occiput and settling with great force in temporal and frontal regions; eyes painful, < from light; pupils contracted. Thirst for large quantities. Temperature 104°F. Pulse full flowing. Lycopers. 3x every hour given in evening removed headache before midnight. Next day right tonsil swollen and inflamed; sore on swallowing; feeling of a lump there. Temperature 101°. Rapidly got well." ],
