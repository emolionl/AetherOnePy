    "Characteristics" : [ "Sumbul, as its name, \"Musk-root, \", implies, has an odour resembling that of musk. The resemblance is so close that Sumbul is used to adulterate musk. Sumb. was proved by Lembke, Cattell, and others, and the symptoms are as like to those of Moschus as the physical resemblance would imply. Hysterical mood; easy fainting; nervous palpitation; are common to both. Hale gives the following indications: (1) Nasal and pharyngeal catarrh, with nervousness, sleeplessness, and tendency to spasms (especially in children); discharge of tenacious, yellow mucus. (2) Ascarides, with bloated, drum-like. abdomen and constipation, picking nose (cured with Sumb. 15). (3) Oily pellicle in urine. (4) Pain in left uterine region. (5) Asthma: catarrhal, spasmodic, or cardiac. (6) Climacteric flushings. (7) Neuralgia: facial or ovarian, in women of quick and lively nervous constitutions. (8) Neuralgia of left hypochondrium, simulating angina pectoris; with palpitation; in nervous women. (9) Insomnia of chronic alcoholism. Peculiar Sensations of Sumb. are: Tongue as if scraped. Like a string pulling in right breast. Corkscrew pains in (left) uterus and appendages. Clogged sensation in left chest. As if heart beating in water. The left side was more affected than the right. The symptoms are < by motion. < After sitting. < By inspiration. < By cold. > By warmth. < Thinking of symptoms. < In morning. Music = faintness." ],
