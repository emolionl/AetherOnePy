R., ix. 549) proved the tincture of Banana flowers and produced costiveness and sensation of fulness about anus, in a person of regular habits; and he cured with it a bad case of bleeding haemorrhoids. It also produced pain in the bladder and passage of mucus with urine. Crichton Campbell commends bananas baked in their skins as an ideal food, or even a \"cure, \", for brain workers, nervous persons, and anaemics (H. W., xxxii. 478).
