    "Clinical" : [ "Eyes, inflammation of. Rhus poisoning." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "The Hydrophyllaceae are nearly allied to the Borages. They grow among moist, shady rocks, and they derive their name from the circumstance that in spring a small quantity of water is held in the cavity of each leaf. The older writers speak of Hydrophyl. v. as an antidote to Rhus poisoning. The only homoeopathic experience on record is that of Dr. Hoyt, of Indiana, which is recorded by Hale. Ten minutes after gathering a cluster of the beautiful blue flowers, Hoyt noticed his eyes began to water and burn, with slight itching, By the time he reached home he was suffering severely, eyelids swollen, sclerotics fiery red, some sensitiveness to light. The symptoms continued through afternoon and evening and kept him awake some time. In the morning, the lids were agglutinated and eyes sensitive to light. The burning and smarting were less, but lachrymation remained, and it was a week before the eyes were quite right. Later on Dr. Hoyt tested the remedy in one case of catarrhal inflammation of the eyes, which it cured \"like magic.\" It needs further proving that it may have its position defined. It should prove to be a good adjunct to Euphrasia." ]
