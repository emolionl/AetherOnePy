    "Characteristics" : [ "The bulk of the symptoms of Zn. m. are derived from poisoning cases. Chloride of Zinc is an active poison and a powerful disinfectant., and being readily accessible in the form of \"Sir Wm. Burnett's Disinfectant Fluid, \", has occasioned many poisonings, both accidental and suicidal. Most of the symptoms are the usual effects of a corrosive poison, but some characteristic symptoms appear. One of them was the perversion of the senses of smell and taste: Things had a putrid smell and taste which were not putrid; and faeces had no odour at all. Quinine had no bitter taste, and acids and alkalies had no acid or alkaline taste. Insipid things were most relished. Other symptoms were: \"No natural appetite, but a morbid craving for something to allay the irritation at the stomach.\" \"Vomiting of all food except boiled milk.\" \"Occasional attacks of tetanic spasms of right forearm and hand.\" \"Emaciation; skin looked as if stretched tightly over bones of face and hands.\" \"Bluish and blue-mottled skin.\" \"Sleeps on right side with legs drawn up, grinds teeth.\" Spasmodic twitchings of face and hands, sprains and convulsions were prominent features. De Noe Walker used a dilution of Zn. m. as an application to fresh wounds, and found it very effectual in securing rapid healing." ],
