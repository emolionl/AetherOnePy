    "Characteristics" : [ "The genus to which this orchid belongs received its name from the spiral arrangement of the flowers. The tuberous roots of Spir. autum. were \"formerly esteemed as an aphrodisiac\" (Treas. of Bot.). The tincture of the root was proved by Dr. Patti Chagon, Duc de Sorentino, who says of it: \"The action of this drug begins with decided symptoms of inflammation of the eyes, chin, chest, which become red and hot; the whole skin is dry and hot; the hands are burning, the extremities of the feet are cold most of the time; there is a sensation of oppression and heat, with palpitation and a desire to uncover.\" This condition lasted two hours and gave place to others, including desire to meditate and complain, vertigo, pains in shoulders, ennui, loss of appetite. The last symptoms to appear are: pains in scalp, on vertex, distress in kidneys and intestinal troubles after eating. The secretions of urine and milk were first diminished, afterwards increased. The aphrodisiac property of Spiran. was shown in some of the symptoms of the proving, and this bears on the increased secretion of milk. A number of symptoms appear in the lower abdomen, and the globus hystericus rises from thence to oesophagus. Heat in lower abdomen; preceding eructations; caused by laughing. Among the Peculiar Symptoms are: cerebral troubles on bending or raising the arm. Sensation of a band tied round head. Sensation of a foreign body in throat. Coldness of teeth. Pulsation in arteries over whole body. Coldness of the affected part. Preference for lying on left side; or else on back. Pain followed by numbness. The symptoms are < by touch. < Bending or raising arm. < Raising breast. Laughing = heat in lower abdomen. Least emotion = palpitation. < Mental effort. > Lying on left side. > Lying on back. < Bending over (rheumatism of shoulders). < Stooping." ],
