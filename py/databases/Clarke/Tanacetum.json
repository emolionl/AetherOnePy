    "Characteristics" : [ "The common Tansy (the word is derived from αθανασια, immortality), with its deep-yellow button-like flowers, a close companion of the Rag-wort (Senecio Jacobea) on our commons and in our hedgerows, takes a not unimportant part in giving colour to the landscape. In olden times puddings were made containing Tansy leaves, and these puddings were called \"tansies\" also. \"In the springtime are made with the leaves hereof newly sprung up, and with eggs, cakes or tansies, which be pleasant in taste and good for the stomach. For if any bad humours cleave thereunto, it doth perfectly concoct them and scour them downwards\" (Gerarde). Gerarde also says that the seeds kill and expel worms of every sort; the root is good in gout; and being drunk with wine Tan. relieves pain in the bladder, and dysuria when a man is only able to urinate by, drops. Like Senec., Tan. has an action on the female generative organs, and a large proportion of the observations with it have been on women who have taken it to procure abortion. Other effects are from its use as a vermifuge, and in addition to these are provings by Burt and others. In Russia Tan. has a reputation as a remedy for hydrophobia. M. Peyraud (C. D. P.) has even used Tan. as a substitute for Pasteurian \"vaccinations, \", and reports success. Experiments on animals show that Tan. induces all the cardinal features of rabies: convulsions, frothy, bloody mucus in the air passages, hallucinations, convulsions without loss of consciousness, opisthotonos, spasms of pharynx, larynx, and thorax, abundant salivation, sensual excitability, tendency to bite, hoarse cry, diminished sensibility and mobility, momentary paralysis, sub-pleural ecchymoses, infarctions of the liver", "rabies tanacetica, simili-rabies being the name suggested by Peyraud for this drug-disease. Whether the convulsions of Tan. be rabic or epileptic, they are sufficiently similar to render the drug useful in either condition. W. H. Pierson (H. W., xxx. quoting N. A. J. H.) observed a woman who took two drachms of the oil to procure abortion. The attempt failed, but throughout her pregnancy she suffered from mixed tonic and clonic convulsions, frothing at the mouth, clenched hands, thumbs turned in, followed by exhaustion and a short coma. Since then Pierson treated every case of epilepsy which came to him with drop doses of the fluid extract of Tan. four times a day, and with marked success. Hale mentions as having been cured with Tan.: Amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, uterine cramps, and metritis. In one instance it caused a large abscess of the labium majus. Hale says a crystallisable acid identical with Santonin has been isolated from it. Suddenness is a characteristic of a number of the symptoms. Peculiar Sensations are: As if something closed the ears very suddenly. His own voice sounds strange in his ears. As though arms and legs suddenly swollen. Sensation like a thrill all through body. The symptoms were < at night, and at a.m." ],
