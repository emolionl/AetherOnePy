    "Characteristics" : [ "The introduction of Salicylic acid and Nat. sal. into general practice as remedies in rheumatism led to much overdosing, the records of which are found in Allen and C. D. P., and I have arranged them below in the Schema. The most marked and persistent of the symptoms produced by Nat. sal. is giddiness, < on rising from lying, and intense tinnitus aurium with deafness. This combination of symptoms has led to the successful homoeopathic use of Nat. sal. in Meniere's disease and similar conditions. In some of the overdosings high fever with delirium was produced. Nat. sal. has been used freely in the manufacture of beer to prevent fermentation, and this has caused poisoning symptoms, notably sweating and tenderness of the feet with dark coloured and enlarged veins (H. W., xxv. 566). Nat. sal. has evidently an affinity for the joints, since it causes many of its poisoning symptoms simultaneously with the removal of the joint pains of gout and rheumatism. It has been used with success in homoeopathic practice in the treatment of periosteal rheumatism. Divergent strabismus and stammering were marked pathogenetic effects in one case, and should lead to homoeopathic uses. It has caused irritation of inguinal glands, and has cured abscess in axilla. Having given Nat. sal. to a patient recovering from influenza who had symptoms of vertigo with noises in the head, the patient was so much relieved by the medicine of her weakness and depression that she named the remedy her \"tonic.\" W. R. Rice published a case in the Brit. Med. Jour., November in which he gave a lady 10-gr. doses of Nat. sal. every four hours. After the third dose \"most alarming prostration, mental and bodily, \", set in. Pulse became weak and compressible, fell to per minute, and the temperature became subnormal. On stopping Nat. sal. the symptoms rapidly passed off. Ebstein has claimed for Nat. sal. in ordinary dosage a controlling power over glycosuria, and R. T. Williamson (B. M. J., March 1901) has confirmed this in some cases." ],
