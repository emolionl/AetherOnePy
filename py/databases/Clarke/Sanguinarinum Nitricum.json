    "Characteristics" : [ "Sang. nit. is a very fine brownish-red powder, pungent, acid, bitter, and inodorous. It is soluble in alcohol, ether, water, and oils, but not in the same proportion in all. Pure Sanguinarin. is a pearly-white substance, but when combined with any of the acids the result is a salt of some shade of red, crimson or scarlet. The colour of the blood-root may thus be due to the presence of some native salt of Sanguinarin. (Hale). Sng. n. was proved in 3x trituration by Professor Owens (C. D. P.), of Pulte Medical College, and some very striking symptoms were elicited. The catarrhal symptoms of Sang. appear in great intensity", "nose, eyes, throat, and bronchi being affected. Lachrymation, pains in eyes and head, sore scalp, obstructed nose, and burning pains throughout all regions were experienced. A sense of obstruction is very characteristic: Sensation of obstruction and fulness in the head; accumulation of mucus obstructing nose; awakes frequently with dry mouth, the nose being obstructed. Accumulation of mucus behind centre of sternum; sense of suffocation; feeling is if air-passages lined with thick, stiff mucus or pus. Heat and tension behind sternum is characteristic; and so is expectoration of quantities of sweet-tasting mucus. There is also expectoration of thin, frothy, tenacious mucus. The symptoms of influenza are very, completely even to the loss or perversion of taste. Sng. n. appears to have the symptoms of Sang. in an enhanced degree. \"Sensation arising to nostrils as if he had eaten strong horseradish, \", is present. Hale gives these verifications. (1) Mr. B., dark, had for eight in spite of continuous old-school treatment, chronic post-nasal catarrh, bronchitis, and laryngitis. Voice altered, deep, hoarse; speech with effort, as if from chest. Severe pressure from behind sternum. Mucous membrane dry, raised only a few halls of grey mucus. He spent two winters on the St. John's River, Florida, and was > there, but < again on his return north. Sng. n. trit. was given every two hours. In one week he was better; there was more moisture in his throat than there had been for two years. Voice markedly better. Sng. n. was now given every four hours. In ten weeks he had regained six pounds of his lost weight, and strength in proportion. The voice not having improved in the same degree, Caust. and afterwards Dros. were given, and in sixteen weeks he was perfectly well. (2) Mrs. S., city missionary, had constant hacking cough, raw, sore feeling in throat, sore aching and pressing behind sternum. She was much exposed to cold winds of winter, which set up coryza and irritation. Sng. n. trit. gr. i., every two hours, enabled her to follow her occupation without suffering, and in ten weeks she was completely cured. (3) O. W., subject to frequent attacks of cold in head, throat, and chest. After a long drive in open trap contracted a severe cold in head, throat, lungs. Sore and lame all over; frequent sneezing, lachrymation. Next day sore throat very marked, constant tickling in throat-pit, exciting cough, at first short and hacking, but in two days it became violent and convulsive. Bell. and Dros. did little good. Pressure behind sternum became very severe. Sng. n. was given every two hours. In four hours copious perspiration came on with frequent sneezing. Next day sore throat appeared after waking from a troubled and restless sleep; constriction of throat with difficult swallowing; tension across chest radiating from behind sternum. Sng. n. every hour. In one hour free discharge from nose set in; in three hours moisture and relaxation of constriction across chest. The discharge was yellow and sweetish-tasting, continued all day. Slept well and woke next morning feeling quite free. But little cough or coryza during the day. The following morning he was quite well.", "Hering gives this case cured with Sng. n. trit.: Troublesome cough for number of years; excited by an irritation in region of bifurcation of bronchi; coughs a long time to raise a little whitish-yellow phlegm, sometimes streaked with blood, after which she feels great >; cough day and night; is greatly emaciated. Owens (M. A., xvii. 31) relates these cases: (1) Mrs. B., widow, fair, catarrhal constitution. Chronic cough many years. Asthmatic on taking cold, great accumulation during attacks, occasionally raising frothy, viscid mucus tinged with blood. Gastric catarrh. Great epigastric tenderness. On October seized with severe catarrhal symptoms, sneezing, burning in nostrils, fluent, watery, mucous discharge from nose, aching in forehead. Cough dry, hollow. Sng. n. 3x, gtt. xx., in six ounces of water, two teaspoonfuls every hour. Complete relief in four hours; usually took three days. (2) Dr. G. had hay-fever, at its height on August 21st. Sensation of cobwebs across nose ten days before attack is fully established. Nose feels large, tingles, trickling water-mucous membrane very sensitive to cold air, causing frequent sneezing. < Light. < Rising in morning. Eyes itch, could almost rub them out. Sng. n. relieved this attack somewhat. Next year he commenced taking, it in June, and passed through the season without any attack. C. Wesselhoeft regards Sng. n. as the simillimum for \"New England colds.\" Adenoids and polypi have been cured with it. The c is great craving for air. Bathing with warm water > heat in forehead. Touch <. Pressure < soreness of eyes. Headache is > by discharge of much mucus from nose. < At night." ],
