    "Clinical" : [ "Diphtheria. Putrid fevers." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "I mention this plant, which is a popular remedy in the Eastern States, because it has been used in place of Ech. ang. It has probably a very similar action, and the root causes the same pungent sensation on lips and tongue as the tincture of Ech. ang. It well deserves a proving. The black root has been taken as a \"signature\" of the remedy in cases of low fevers where a black tongue was observed." ]
