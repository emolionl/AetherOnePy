    "Characteristics" : [ "Viburnum opulus, a native of Great Britain, is widely distributed over the northern parts of the continent and America. In America (says Hale) the wild species is called \"Cramp bark, \", and the knowledge of its curative virtues in painful spasmodic diseases, especially in dysmenorrhoea, is derived from the American aborigines. The tincture has a strong odour of Valerianic acid (as also has that of Vib. tinus). Hale derived his knowledge from domestic sources. He gives these indications and directions: (1) In spasmodic dysmenorrhoea he gives a few drops of O to 3x thrice daily for a week before the period, every hour when the pains set in, or every fifteen minutes if the pains are severe. (2) False pains preceding labour. (3) After-pains, a dose after each pain. (4) Cramps in abdomen and legs of pregnant women. (5) To prevent miscarriage when the pains are spasmodic or threatening. Hale considers it acts like galvanism; he cured with it cases exactly resembling a series cured with galvanism by Neftel. The first provings were by H. C. Allen, assisted by eleven provers, male and female, with O and 1st and 30th dilutions. Their symptoms constitute the basis of the Schema. Dr. Susan J. Fenton, of Oakland (Pac. C. J. H., reprinted New Eng. M. Gaz., xxx. 405), proved Vib. o. on six provers. One of the six took the tincture up to drachm doses without obtaining a single symptom. One prover was cured of a number of symptoms, but developed no new ones. The other four had very pronounced symptoms, which I have marked in the Schema (F1), (F2), (F3), and (F4). They were: (1) Mrs. A., tall, slender, rigid fibre, dark hair and eyes, nervo-bilious, (F1). (2) Miss B., short, plump, dark hair, grey eyes, phlegmatic, (F2). (3) Miss D., nurse, short, plump, dark hair and eyes, bilious, good health, (F3). (4) Miss E., nurse, medium height, dark-brown eyes, dark hair, bright, lively temperament, (F4). All took potencies at first without eliciting any symptoms. Taking the tincture all had these symptoms with variations: severe backache going through to the front or round the abdomen to uterus. Cramping pelvic pain. Temporal headache. Three had nausea with the pains. All had \"sick feeling all over.\"", "One had omission of a period; two had menses too early. The cured case was the following: Miss F., housekeeper, medium height, rather slender, blonde, sanguine, was strong till late in (i.e., 1/2 years before the proving), when she had severe pelvic congestion and was fifteen months under treatment and most of the time in bed. In June, double oophorectomy was performed with great relief; but attacks of pelvic congestion with severe pain still persisted, at first every two to four weeks, later less frequently, causing impairment of general health and strength. The symptoms were: excruciating pains through lower abdomen, with bearing-down sensation and a feeling as if the body from the waist to lower part of pelvis would collapse; an indescribable sick feeling all over with severe aching in rectum; great depression of spirits; symptoms > when lying down. Vib. o. O was taken in three-drop doses thrice daily. After taking it for three days she lost all her symptoms and felt \"perfectly well for the first time in over four years.\" It is evident that \"sick feeling all over\" in connection with pelvic complaints; and \"< from movement, > by rest\" are keynotes of Vib. o. Peculiar Sensations are: As if she could not tell where she was or what to do on awaking. Crushing pain in head. Opening and shutting in left parietal region. As if stabbing with a knife in eyes and ears. Ear as if bruised; as if pinned to head. As if she could not live, sick feeling at stomach. Sick feeling all over. Goneness as if stomach empty. As if body from waist to lower pelvis would collapse. As if a hot fluid running through splenic vessels. As if urine continued to flow after urinating. As if menses coming on. As if pelvic organs were turning upside down. As if parts would be forced through vulva and she must support the part. Pain in back and across lower abdomen. As if breath would leave body and heart would cease beating. Bruised feeling in back as after severe exertion. Buzzing in hands as if they would burst. Left side as if strained or bruised by over-lifting.", "The left side is much more powerfully affected than the right. Vib. o. is Suited to tall, slender, dark- or fair-haired hysterical subjects. The symptoms are: < By sudden jar. > By pressure. < By motion. Rest; lying down >. Lying on left side impossible. Straining at stool < headache. Stooping = dizziness. Rising = fainting, nausea, and dizziness. < At night. < In close room. Open air >." ],
