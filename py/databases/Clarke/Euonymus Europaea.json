    "Characteristics" : [ "The Celastraceae, to which order Euonymus belongs, are closely related to the Rhamnaceae which include the well-known purgative Cascara sagrada. A case of poisoning with the seeds of Euon. eur. (Allen) recalls the effects of Euonymin: \"A man, forty-three, took eighteen seeds one morning, and as many the following evening. He was seized with frightful abdominal pain, profuse diarrhoea, eventually bloody. He was not seen till the evening, when he was in a state of profound collapse, with involuntary evacuations of blood and mucus. On lifting him up tetanic convulsions were induced which immediately preceded death.\" Euon. has been used successfully in cases of engorgement of the liver, \"biliousness, \", headache, coated tongue, bad taste, constipation, passive constipation with haemorrhoids; also with severe pain in back like lumbago. In diarrhoea the stool is generally very profuse; variable in colour. In gastric derangements with albuminuria; headache; weakness; vertigo and obscuration of sight. Euon. eur. has been proved. Cutting, sticking and drawing pains predominate. The left side is more affected than the right. Cutting pains in the malar bones; in the tongue. Cutting in the penis extends up to the bladder. The pains compel lying down, and are then relieved or reappear in other parts. Violent shivering chill over whole body. Pains in chest, head and abdomen are < after eating. Tingling in the skin which provokes scratching is followed by a burning sensation. Eruption of small dry pustules." ],
