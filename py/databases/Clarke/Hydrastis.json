    "Characteristics" : [ "The so-called root of Hydrastis from which the tincture is made is really a perennial underground stem, thick, knotty, and yellow. The yellow colour is very intense, and it has been used by Indians as a dye. The plant is the only specimen of its genus among the Ranunculaceae. It grows in shady woods, in rich soil, and damp meadows. The fruit is like a raspberry, and the plant is sometimes called Ground Raspberry in consequence. The medicinal properties of Hydrast. were known to the aborigines of America. The first mention of it in medical literature is by Rafinesque (Medical Botany, 1828). Hale quotes him as saying that it is \"tonic, ophthalmic, detergent, \", and that \"it is said to enter into compound remedies for cancer, acting as a detergent tonic, and the Cherokees are supposed to use it in that disease.\" This is important as showing that the traditional reputation of the plant agrees with the results of later experience. For though by no means a specific in all cases of cancer, it is in cancer cases that Hydrast. has won its chief fame; and I think it may fairly be said that more cases of cancer have been cured with it than with any other single remedy. Thanks to the excellent provings that have been made by homoeopaths and the careful observations of able practitioners, we are in a position to use the remedy with much greater precision than formerly. In very many cancer cases there is what has been termed a \"pre-cancerous stage, \", a period of undefined ill-health without any discernible new growth. This stage is generally marked by symptoms of dyspepsia, and this frequently takes the Hydrastis type, which has been well described by A. C. Clifton. The facial expression is dull, heavy, sodden-looking; yellowish-white in colour. The tongue is large, flabby and slimy-looking; bluish-white under the fur (which is yellow, slimy, and sticky), and indented by the teeth. Eructations generally sour, at times putrid. Appetite bad, the power of digesting bread and vegetables especially weak and causing eructations. Weight at stomach, with fulness, empty aching \"gone\" feeling (this is a grand characteristic of Hydrast., and it is constant, not occurring at special times like that of Sul., &c.). < After a meal. The action of the bowels is either infrequent and constipated, or frequent with loose, soft, light-coloured stools. Clifton found this type of dyspepsia occur frequently in phthisical families, and often cured it; and even in cases of actual phthisis this type is not uncommon, the loss of appetite and \"goneness\" being especially prominent. In dyspepsia Clifton found the tincture and lower attenuations answer best; in catarrh of nose and fauces the higher were better. Catarrh of almost all mucous surfaces is caused by Hydrastis", "nasal catarrh, pharyngeal, bronchial, gastric, duodenal, intestinal, urethral (gonorrhoea, gleet), vaginal. The characteristic catarrh is yellow (the leading colour of the drug) or white; tough and stringy. The action on the skin is no less marked. Garth Wilkinson found it externally and internally an excellent remedy in small-pox. Eczema impetiginoides, drying into crusts and burning like fire, has been cured with an application of one part Hydras. O to nine of glycerine. The burning was removed at once. (I once saw a woman, who had been given Hydrast. O gtt. v. in water three times a day, after a week come out in a scarlet rash, raised and nodular, exceedingly irritable, especially at night. It was on every part of the body except the face, and was worst on buttocks and elbows. It remained out a week. The patient at the same time became very ill with sickness and general digestive disorder.) The skin may be jaundiced. There is excessive sweat, especially of armpits or genitals; offensive ulcers; chancroids; fissures. The female genital organs are very much affected: Metrorrhagia, leucorrhoea, pruritus vulvae, scirrhus of uterus; of breasts; sore mouth of nursing-women; sore nipples. Weiss gave a woman, who had had adherent placenta in several confinements in succession, Hydrast. 3x three drops daily from the fourth month during her last three pregnancies, and each terminated without adherent placenta. Four other cases of habitual adherent placenta were successfully treated in the same way. There is much backache of severe character in connection with many of the Hydrast. conditions. Sometimes it awakens patients in the night. Like many other \"yellow\" medicines, it has a marked action on the liver, causing jaundice and liver enlargement. Cases of cancer of the liver have been reported cured by it. Fulness, goneness, and constipation are the leading indications. The constipation of Hydrast. is a leading feature of the pathogenesis. There is torpor of the bowels; stools lumpy, covered with yellowish tough mucus; with the constipation continual pain in head, bad taste in mouth. Hydrast. has been a good deal used in bronchial catarrhs with the characteristic tenacious secretion. In one case an over-dose brought on a characteristic attack of asthma (H. W., xxxiv. 293). The dose was gtt xx of the liquid extract, and Miodowski, who reported the case, thought there was pulmonary oedema secondary to cardiac weakness induced by the drug. It is worthy of note that most remedies which powerfully act on the skin will also cause an asthmatic state. The symptoms generally are < at night. Skin symptoms are < from warmth; from washing, &c.
