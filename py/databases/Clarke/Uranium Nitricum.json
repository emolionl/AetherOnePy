    "Characteristics" : [ "Uranium belongs to the Chromium group of elements. Ur. nit. was proved by E. T. Blake, whose monograph on the salt forms part of the Hahnemann Materia Medica. Blake's proving was suggested by the observation of an old-school experimenter, Leconte, who found sugar in the urine of dogs slowly poisoned with Ur. nit. Blake was not very successful in producing sugar, but his proving is not any less valuable on that account, and clinical use has filled out the picture. Many cases of diabetes have been relieved or cured by Ur. nit., usually in the lower attenuations. In a case of diabetes insipidus of mine, in a young girl, Ur. nit. gave more relief than any other remedy. Excessive thirst, polyuria, and dry tongue are the indications. Glycosuria is by no means an essential part of the indications for Ur. nit. In some of the animals experimented on by Blake the pylorus was found to be affected. With this the symptoms of the proving correspond, and Ur. nit. has cured both pyloric and gastric ulcer. One case (N. A. J. H., Aug., 1890) in a married woman was cured with 5-gr. doses of the 2x. Patient was weak and emaciated; vomited mucus mixed with blood and coffee-ground matter, and passed dark, tarry stools; sensitive and tender over region of pylorus. Sensations are: As if blood were flowing to head. As if he had taken cold with headache. The left side was more affected than the right. Many symptoms were < at night. Head < walking. > Deep inspiration." ],
