    "Characteristics" : [ "Iodoform has been proved by Underwood and Haines. To the symptoms experienced by them have been added the recorded effects observed on patients treated with it in old-school practice. Many cases of fatal poisoning have occurred. All the symptoms of acute meningitis have been produced in some instances, and this fact has been turned to good account by homoeopathists. An excellent collection of the pathogenetic effects of Idf. will be found in C. D. P., from which I take the following: A boy of had Idf. thickly applied to a point in amputated limb at which the stitches did not hold well. On the third day he was sleepy, after a restless night with frequent sighing. The dressing was renewed, and on the same day, not having eaten anything since the day before, he had several attacks of vomiting, bilious and easy. All these symptoms increased during the next few days. The child was constipated and seemed to suffer from his head. Nights very restless; sleep interrupted by sighing and cries like those of meningitis. Drowsiness during day. Pupils unequally contracted; reacted slowly to light. He was perfectly indifferent and did not recognise those about him. Later, nightly agitation was replaced by tranquil delirium. Pulse rapid and small. On the sixth day the dressing was changed, on the seventh day the symptoms began to abate, and disappeared after the ninth. W. J. Martin (Hahn. Month., xxxi. 799) cured two cases of tubercular meningitis with Idf. 2x. He put grains in half a tumbler of water, and gave a teaspoonful every two hours. One case was that of a child, fourteen months old, and the symptoms were: Sleeps much; moves mouth constantly as though chewing or sucking; bores head back and rolls it from side to side. Had been ill twelve days. Violent convulsions followed, face distorted, eyes squinting, head retracted, neck and back stiff, automatic movement of one arm and leg. The child was expected to die that night, but Idf. was now given, and improvement set in. Fever abated, and in one week all symptoms had passed away. Drowsiness is a marked feature. In cases of medicinal poisoning the symptoms sometimes come speedily, and sometimes only after a long period of medication, when they set in with great suddenness and intensity. For instance, a woman, who had taken grains of Idf. in eighty days, suddenly after a hot bath felt very dizzy and weak in the legs, felt unable to knit, and diplopia set in. Symptoms of mania followed; weakness, staggering on closing the eyes. For twelve days she was unable to walk alone. These symptoms having set in suddenly after a hot bath seems to show that the \"< by heat, and by damp\" of Iod. is reproduced in Idf. Treves has observed evidences of poisoning develop slowly and insidiously: Malaise, loss of strength and of appetite, occasional vomiting; and the patient is weighed down with a sense of depression; moderate fever, rapid pulse; drowsiness; complete hebetude; wasting. The external use of it has set up eczema. In one case, that of a soldier (H. W., xxv. 292) who had had Iodoform applied to his arm, a scarlatina-like rash appeared, spreading from the arm over the body, and ending in desquamation. Scarlatina was actually diagnosed, but some doubt was raised, and, suspicion being thrown on the Idf., a piece of silver was placed in the mouth. Immediately a garlic taste was experienced showing the presence of Idf., which other tests confirmed. Idf. imparts a garlic odour to silver. The symptoms are < at night; by warmth; by motion; by touch; by riding in cars. > By uncovering." ],
