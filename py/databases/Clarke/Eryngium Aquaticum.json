    "Characteristics" : [ "Eryngium acts on the mucous membranes, producing thick yellow mucous discharges from eyes, ears, nose, mouth, bowels, urethra, and vagina. Haemorrhages from stomach and bowels. It is a vulnerary, antidoting the effect of blows. It causes headaches; expanding sensation in forehead; dull, dragging pain in occiput, neck, and shoulders. Seminal and prostatic weakness. I. J. Whitfield has cured three cases of renal colic with calculi (two left side, the other not stated) with Eryng. a. W. K. Leonard reports the following case: A young Methodist minister, apparently healthy, was just over his twelfth attack of renal colic. The attacks had recurred at intervals of two to four weeks and lasted from one to three days, and they were so weakening as to keep him incapacitated in the intervals. He had had old-school treatment, including Morphine and Quinine, with no benefit. Eryng. a. O, five drops three times a day, put an end to the trouble. The attacks had been attended with severe nervous chills, and it was for these that the Quinine had been prescribed. Eryng. has a cough with a sense of constriction. (Hale found it useful in epidemic influenza when there was raw smarting burning in throat and larynx, with constant irritating cough and expectoration of yellow mucus.) Loss of energy and nervous erethism. Most symptoms occur on left side, and extend or move from part to part. Motion < all symptoms. Bending head forward < head symptoms; turning eyes = pain in them. < From mental exertion. Heat >." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Eryngium compares with the other Umbelliferae: with Aethus. in inability to concentrate thoughts; with Conium as a vulnerary; in discharge of prostatic fluid from slight causes.
