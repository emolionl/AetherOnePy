    "Characteristics" : [ "The Chlorate of Potash is not to be confounded with the chloride which constitutes the Kali muriaticum of Schussler. Hering has amalgamated the symptoms of the two under the heading Kali mur., but I think it best to keep them separate. Kali chlor. is an exceedingly active poison. It has long been used in the old school, in solution, as a wash for sore mouth and for foul ulcers. Hutchinson observed a number of case in which it produced the very condition which it was given to cure: \"Most acute ulceration and follicular stomatitis. The whole mucous surface was red and tumid, and in the cheeks, lips, &c., were numerous grey-based ulcers.\" Rushmore (H. P., xii. 530) records a proving in an unmarried lady, short, brunette, who had had goitre in early life, which disappeared under the application of Iodine. Later on a fibroid tumour developed in the uterus, and for this the patient was advised to take crude Potassium chlorate, dissolved in water, daily. The following symptoms were observed: Increased moral irritability. Felt dreadfully dull and stupid. Dizzy on stooping and rising. Slight headache over eyes, objects appear double, beside each other. Face swelled so she could hardly see on rising in morning. Smarting of tongue. It took away her desire for acids. Diminished appetite. Much commotion and flatulence in abdomen. Increased urine. Dreams worse, of terrible things never thought of. Great coolness; shivering on cold days; seemed as if it cooled off her blood. Clumsiness. General bloated feeling.", "Fatal poisoning has occurred, death taking place in convulsions. The blood is disorganised, and after death liver, spleen and kidneys are found softened and filled with disorganised blood; this should give it a place in cases of lardaceous and fatty degeneration of solid viscera. Mouth, hypochondria, and rectum are the parts most affected. In the provers great weakness was manifested, rheumatic and neuralgic pains, many occurring in the facial nerves. Facial paralysis has been cured with it. The heart was the seat of much disturbance, and a coldness was felt about the precordia. The stomach and bowels were disordered, and Allen credits it with the cure of this: \"Dysentery, with most violent cutting pains as from knives, frequent stools, tenesmus, making the patient cry out, evacuations very small, almost pure blood, great prostration.\" The sexual organs were excited. The skin also manifested a number of symptoms: Pimples in various parts; between lip and chin. It has cured epithelioma of face and of great toe (Allen). Sir James Simpson recommended it in 20-grain doses daily where abortion was likely to occur from fatty degeneration of the placenta (Brunton). As this is frequently a syphilitic affection it is probable that when successful it neutralised that disease. < By jar of coughing or sneezing (eyes). Mental symptoms > by nose-bleed." ],
