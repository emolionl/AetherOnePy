    "Characteristics" : [ "Under the name of Brucea antidysenterica a quantity of Nux vomica bark got upon the drug market, and was at first supposed to be Angustura bark.

It contains strychnine, and the symptoms are included in the pathogenesis of Nux vomica and Strychninum. The homoeopathic preparation of Nux vom. is, however, prepared from the seed.
