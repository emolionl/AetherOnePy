    "Characteristics" : [ "The deep red colour of the tincture of Hamamelis may be taken as the signature of its therapeutic action. No remedy has a wider sphere of usefulness in cases of haemorrhage and disordered blood-vessels. It has also a decided relation to the effects of mechanical injuries including burns of the first degree, and as a local application it takes rank with Arnica and Calendula in the homoeopathic amamentarium. Hering, who learned its properties from Mr. Pond, of \"Pond's Extract\" fame (Pond was a patient of Hering's), made the first provings and introduced the remedy into homoeopathy. He defines its position as being between Acon. and Arn. \"Pond's Extract\" is an aqueous distillate prepared from the leaves. A number of interesting superstitions are associated with the shrub; and shoots of it are used as \"divining rods\" for discovering water and metals. Hale has given a very full account of the remedy. Phlebitis; varicosis; haemorrhoids; venous haemorrhages", "these are the conditions likely to require Hamam. The local application of Hamam. to a sprained knee has been known to set up inflammation in the veins of the part, and the provers who had varicose veins experienced in them increased sensitiveness and unusual sensations, and a number were cured. In congestion, inflammation, and bleeding of haemorrhoidal vessels, Ham. has a great range of action; and like that other great pile remedy, Aesculus h., it has also a marked action in the throat. Ham. is called for in cases of \"varicose angina, \", where the veins of the pharynx are large and blue. The haemorrhages in which Ham. is indicated are mostly dark. They may occur from any orifice. Metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, vicarious menstruation and haemorrhages between the periods are met by it. In this connection a case recorded by Dr. Ward (Pacif. Coast J. of H., November, 1899) is noteworthy. He cured a case of intermenstrual pain. Allen mentions in the provings an intermenstrual flow, and Dr. Ward acutely observes that if his patient has had the flow, the soreness so distinctly felt might not have been realised. \"Intense soreness\" is one of the notes of Hamamelis. The part from which the flow of blood proceeds feels sore and bruised. This distinguishes it from Chi. in passive haemorrhages. It is a leading indication for it in cases of orchitis and ovarian affections; and also in phlebitis and varicose veins. In piles there is much bleeding and marked soreness of the part; the back feels as if it would break (Aesc. h. has little or no bleeding). There is taste of blood in the mouth. The headache of Ham. is chiefly in the temples, throbbing, hammering; especially over left eye. Hughes gave Ham. O to a young lady suffering from daily epistaxis and throbbing headache. The first dose was followed by a flushing of the face and most distressing throbbing-aching and sense of fulness in the head. The second dose brought back all the symptoms in the head, and a feeling as if it would burst. Some days later the 3x was given, and again the dilatation of the cerebral vessels occurred, though the symptoms were not so severe. The haemorrhage of Ham. causes great exhaustion (out of proportion to the amount of loss), but there is also a tired, aching feeling in the back and lower limbs, independently of haemorrhages. Many rheumatic symptoms occur, and with them always the characteristic soreness. A woman, thirty-five, to whom I gave Ham. for varicosis with great advantage, developed marked loss of appetite and these additional symptoms: \"Pain all round lower abdomen, dreadful aching, rheumatic pain at top of left shoulder and under right shoulder-blade, also right side of chest under arm. Pains < during the day and when at rest, entirely absent during the night. Stupid feeling in head.\" This scapular pain bears on the experience of Dr. Koech, who cured with Ham. many cases of scapular rheumatism. He regards it as a specific in affections of the last five cervical nerves. There is a good deal of thirst in the Ham. pathogenesis, and Bree says (H. P., xii. 61) it will relieve the excessive thirst that most patients with heart troubles complain of. Motion and exertion in general <. < In open air; in rainy weather. Takes cold easily from every exposure, but especially to warm, moist air. Toothache < in warm room. < From touch." ],
