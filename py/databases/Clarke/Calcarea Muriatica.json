    "Clinical" : [ "Boils. Glandular swellings. Impetigo. Scrofula. Vomiting." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "The following symptoms have been noted: Faintness, anxiety and weakness. Trembling and giddiness. Respiration quick and snoring; increased secretion of mucus (as with other chlorides), perspiration and urine. Nausea and vomiting; precordium tender; diarrhoea; pulse accelerated. Cold sweats; convulsions; paralysis. In scrofulous cases it promotes the action of mercury. Under its use glandular swellings and indurations soften and disappear. Hence its use in scrofula and boils. \"C. W.\" has recorded a remarkable instance of the action of this remedy (Hom. W., March, 1891). A scrofulous and rheumatic woman had suffered from abscess of cornea, followed by rheumatic iritis, and a dense opacity was left. An old-school practitioner had treated her with mercurials during two years in a vain endeavour to \"touch her mouth.\" C. W. put one grain of Calc. mur. in an 8-oz. bottle, and directed the patient to take a tablespoonful three times a day. The medicine had not been taken ten minutes before she felt it at her fingers' ends. The mercurial action was evoked, and she was in bed a fortnight, terribly salivated. The condition of the eye was unchanged. Calc. Mur., in the form of the liquor (1 part to of distilled water), was one of Rademacher's \"Stomach Remedies, \", and was used with great success by him in cases of obstinate vomiting. He gave drops of the liquor in half a cup of water five times a day. The indications were: Vomiting of all food and drink; vomiting when no food had been taken; jaundice; pain in left hypochondrium. He also found it indicated in gastric pain; bloating and eructations." ],
