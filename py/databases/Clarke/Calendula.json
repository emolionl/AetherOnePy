Three years ago, just after making the tincture, my old enemy the gout nipped me in the middle of the spine, and in three days spoiled all my powers of walking, and then the dreadful feeling became very much exaggerated.\" His experience led him to conclude that Calendula has an action on the spinal cord." ],
