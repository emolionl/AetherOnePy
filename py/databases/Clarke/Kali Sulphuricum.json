    "Characteristics" : [ "Schussler's account of this remedy is as follows: K. s., which in reciprocal action with iron effects the transfer of the inhaled oxygen to all the cells, is contained in all the cells containing iron. A deficiency of K. s. causes: \"A sensation of heaviness and weariness, vertigo, chilliness, palpitation of the heart, anxiety, sadness, toothache, headache, and pain in the limbs.\" These are < in a room; in warmth; towards evening; > in open, cool air. \"There ensues a desquamation of cells of the epidermis and epithelium, which have been loosened from their connection because they were not sufficiently provided with oxygen. The scaling off of these epithelial cells is followed by catarrhs with a secretion of yellow mucus. Therapeutically K. s. answers to the process of desquamation which takes place after scarlatina, measles, erysipelas of the face, &c.\"; to catarrh of larynx, bronchi, nostrils, &c., where the secretion has the above-named characteristics; to catarrh of stomach, where the tongue has a yellowish mucous coating; to catarrh of middle ear, and of the kidneys. K. s. effects the access of oxygen, and so facilitates the formation of new epithelium. Schussler points out that K. s. and iron carry on the same transference of oxygen in the organic world. When a sulphate and any oxide of iron comes into contact with decomposing organic substances they surrender their oxygen and form sulphurate of iron. By more oxygen this may be further decomposed into sulphuric acid and an oxide of iron. K. s. is Schussler's Pulsatilla. It has had no proper proving, and the fine indications are not so clear as they might be. The leading indications are those given by Schussler", "the Yellow colour of the discharges; the skin and mucous membrane appearances, and the < by warmth and > in open air. M. E. Douglass (H. R., x. 279) reports a case of asthma with thick yellow expectoration, much rattling in chest, laboured breathing, talking almost impossible, cured with K. sul. 3x, five grains every hour in the attack. Hansen cured with K. sul. 3x a case of psoriasis beginning on right leg, later attacking left leg and left elbow. Eruption, papular, oval and annular with paler centres, covered with whitish scales, skin beneath red and smooth. The guiding symptom was \"great desquamation of the epidermis.\" All symptoms are < in evening (Puls. < in twilight). \"Its sphere of action is in lymphatic vessels: when there is lack of this substance, a yellow mucous catarrh arises, or a yellow sticky discharge from isolated places on membranes.\" The pains are wandering: wandering rheumatism (Puls., K. bi.). Gonorrhoea and ophthalmia neonatorum (Puls.)." ],
