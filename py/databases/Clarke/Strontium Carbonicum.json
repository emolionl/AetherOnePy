    "Characteristics" : [ "Native Strontium Carbonate, a mineral named Strontianite, was first discovered in the lead-mines of Strontian in Argyllshire, from whence it received its name. It occurs in massive, fibrous, stellated, rarely orthorhombic crystals. The metal Strontium is dark yellow. Stro. c. varies in colour from white to yellow and pale green. It was proved by Nenning, Schreter, Seidel, Trincks, and Woost. Among the prominent symptoms were flushing in the face and violent pulsation of the arteries; congestion to heart, lungs, and head. The distinctive feature about these states with Stro. c. is that they are > by warmth and wrapping up and < by cold. This also distinguishes the headaches of Stro. c. The headaches are boring, pressive, and tensive. There are various expressions of the congestive state. One of the tensive pains is peculiar: \"Tension from vertex to upper jaw, as if head were expanded from within, and as if scalp were too tight, < in evening when lying with head low, slowly increasing and decreasing, > from heat, The pressure appears in the stomach; it is > by eating; and < by walking. There is also pressure after eating. There is both diarrhoea and constipation, the stools of both are accompanied and followed by burning in the rectum. A. P. Bowie (H. R., ii. 62) cured this case occurring after a tedious labour: Stools large and hard, expelled with great effort, followed by great pain in anus, burning, lasting a long time and compelling patient to lie down. Anus violently contracted after stool. Complains of coldness in spots on calves of legs. Stro. c. entirely relieved. The diarrhoea is < at night, and the stools are yellow. Walking < all complaints: headache; leucorrhoea; dyspnoea; pressure in sternum. The symptoms about the chest and sternum, with the < by walking, suggest angina pectoris, and a similar but less serious state often met with in gouty patients. The tension is manifested in the nape, as if the tendons were drawn up; tensive drawing in dorsal and lumbar muscles. In the arms there is venous tension: \"the veins of the arms and hands are injected and tense, with great prostration and ill-humour\"", "suggesting phlebitis and varicosis. Stro. c. has a relation to sprains and bone affections. The femur is especially affected by it. It is particularly suited to bone affections of scrofulous children when associated with diarrhoea. The diarrhoea of Stro. c. is < at night; is very urgent; can scarcely leave the vessel before having to return; > after a.m. Stro. c. is indicated in chronic sprains of the ankle when oedema exists. C. M. Boger (H. R., xv. 339) cured with Stro. c., after other remedies had failed, a sciatica accompanied by oedema of left ankle. Sensations of Stro. c. are: As if a load on chest. As if head were expanded from within. As if scalp were too tight. As if tendons of neck were drawn up. As if bruised in back and sacrum. As if all power had left right arm. Gnawing as if in marrow of bones. Symptoms as if in marrow of bones. Symptoms like phantoms difficult to locate. External soreness is a note of Stro. c.; also numbness. Emaciation has been caused by it. The symptoms are < by touch; by rubbing; by scratching. Lying with head low < tension in head. Motion <; walking especially <. Stooping <. Exertion <. Motion > weakness of right arm. < Evening; night, and early morning, or a.m. Warmth, covering >. Heat of sun > tension in head. Least draught <. Pain and itching alternate. Right side most affected. Pressure in stomach is > by eating; and < after a meal." ],
