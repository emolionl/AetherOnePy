    "Characteristics" : [ "Santonin. is the favourite anthelmintic of the old school, and it is chiefly against lumbrici that it has been given. From to grains are the ordinary doses, but these have caused severe and, in one or two instances, fatal poisoning", "convulsions, left-side paralysis, delirium, vomiting, and purging have resulted. A case recorded by Demme was quoted in Brit. Med. J., March 1892: A boy, was given by his mother during three days fifteen tablets, each containing gr. 1/3 of Santonin. The symptoms produced were: Vomiting, dilatation of the pupils, collapse, cyanosis, dyspnoea, and finally convulsions. After a warm bath with cold affusions to head and spine, consciousness returned. The temperature was 103.5Â°, epistaxis and haemoglobinuria occurred, and a scarlatina-like eruption was noticed. The child ultimately recovered. After a dose of centigrammes, a child, was seized with prostration, convulsions, cramps, and icterus, followed on the third day by salivation and ulceration of the gum (Bull. Ther. Jan. 1872). Less serious but very characteristic are the effects on the senses, especially the sense of sight. Visions of figures have been produced, and coloured vision is a frequent phenomenon, even when the lower triturations have been used. Yellow is the predominant colour, but green and violet vision are also marked. The urine also is yellow coloured and stains yellow, and is passed with much urging and painful burning. A kind of giant urticaria occurred in one case. Hale records that Sant. has cured cases of \"nervous blindness.\" It was given to an old man, quite blind, for worms, and his sight partially returned. This led to further trials. It was given in nine cases of cataract, and, according to Hale, four were cured, the rest not benefited. Hale mentions enuresis, strangury, chronic cystitis, as having been cured by it. It has made some \"brilliant cures\" of chronic catarrh of the bladder. Infantile remittents, with or without worms, have been cured by it. In one prover there was \"sensitiveness of the abdomen, \", which may be a keynote." ],
