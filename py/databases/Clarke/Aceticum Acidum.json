    "Clinical" : [ "Anaemia. Anaesthetics, antidote to. Ascarides. Burns. Corns. Croup. Debility. Diabetes. Diphtheria. Dropsies. Fevers. Hydrophobia. Naevi. Narcotics, antidote to. Phthisis. Sausage-poisoning, antidote to. Scalds. Stings. Stomach, cancer of. Varicosis. Warts." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "The leading features of acetic acid are excessive wasting and debility; anaemia with waxy pallor of face; intense thirst; burning in throat; nausea, retching, and sour rising as met with in cases of cancer and debility. There are gnawing, ulcerative pains in stomach; pain and burning in abdomen. Profuse, exhausting diarrhoea. It has been used in diabetes. It corresponds to putrid and hectic fevers with night sweats; haemorrhages, varicose swellings, and dropsies. As a type of vinegar effects may be mentioned the following: A plump and blooming young woman took a small glass daily to reduce size. Soon lost flesh and colour. In a month cough set in with white concocted phlegm, fever, dyspnoea, night sweats, anorexia, dropsy, diarrhoea, death. Lungs after death were found stuffed with non-suppurating tubercles. A young German, after working twelve months in a vinegar factory, was obliged to leave from indigestion, dyspnoea, and ready fatigue. It is suited to children and old people; to lax, pale, lean persons. (Equal parts of vinegar and hot water make a refreshing sponge-down for many conditions of fever, with or without perspiration.)" ],
    "Relations" : [ "Compare: Apis, Ars. (but Acet. ac. has more preponderant gastric symptoms than either); Carbol. ac., Lac. defl., Lact. ac., Uran. nit. Large doses of Acet. ac. are best antidoted by Magnesia or Calcarea either as fluid magnesia or as lime-water. Antidotes to potencies are: For depressing, agonising feeling, Tabac., Acon.; for gastric, pulmonary and febrile symptoms, Nat. m., and afterwards Sep. It antidotes: Anaesthetics, Acon., Asar., Coffea, Euphorb., Ignat., Opium, Plumb. (colic), Sep., Stram., Tabac. It counteracts sausage-poisoning. It aggravates the effects of Bell., Merc., Arn., Lach. Disagrees when given after Borax, Caust., Nux v., Ran. b., Sars.: Scilla, Colch., and Sang. have more effect in curing some diseases when prepared with Acet. ac. than with Alcohol." ],
