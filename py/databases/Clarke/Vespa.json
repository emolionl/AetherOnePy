    "Characteristics" : [ "Vespa was introduced into the materia medica by Hering. The symptoms of the Schema Are mostly the results of stings. Berridge proved Vesp. crabro on three persons. Low spirits; pain in right ear; nausea with faint feeling and trembling; pain in left side of the neck on waking", "these were the chief symptoms experienced by them. Berridge demonstrated that the poison of the hornet and the wasp may answer to each other's indications by curing with Vesp. c. cm. (Fincke) a symptom produced by Vesp. vulgaris, namely, chemosis of the right eye. Mr. X., had had his right eye inflamed for six days. When seen there was redness of right lower lid; baggy swelling of conjunctiva partly covering the cornea when pressed upward; lachrymation of right eye < in open air; right lids adhere in morning. Vesp. c. thrice daily cured in a few days (Org., ii. 319). E. T. Blake (M. H. R., xxii. quoted Org., i. 320) cured with Vesp. the following group of symptoms: Face swollen and puffy, skin transparent and blanched; scalding urine followed by itching; itching of right arm. Blake also related (M. H. R., xix. quoted by Allen) the case of Miss C. J., who at the age of thirty-one was stung on the left thumb, through some calico, and was never well after, dying at the age of thirty-eight. She was prone to constipation all her life, and at twenty-three had had \"congestion of the left lung.\" Most of the abdominal, urinary, ovarian, and uterine symptoms were hers. Among the latter was an irritable ulcer surrounding the os tincae. W. Rowbotham (Org., ii. 79) was stung on the right cheek. Next day, about a.m., was suddenly awakened by burning, stinging pain in cheek, \"as if pierced with red-hot needles, \", and soreness and smarting along the lymphatics. After bathing the face he got to sleep and was again suddenly awakened by the pain two hours later, which recurred periodically, in paroxysms, throughout the day. Burnett observed a case of sting on the tongue in a woman. The tongue entirely filled the buccal cavity. The patient's appearance was exactly like one suffering from severe cynanche. The swelling was diffuse and deep-seated. There was not much redness. Peculiar Sensations were: As if a harpoon were sticking deep in and were drawn on. Cold, chilly sensation round sting. As if pierced with red-hot needles. As if about to suffocate. As if left shoulder-joint were sprained. As if a cutting instrument were piercing all joints like an electric shock. As if dying. The symptoms were: < By motion. Cold water applied, first >, then <. Open air < lachrymation. Feet were cold except in summer, when they burned uncomfortably. < After sleep. < After eating (indigestion with flushes)." ],
