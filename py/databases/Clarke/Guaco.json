In the homoeopathic provings rice-water stools occurred; and difficulty of swallowing as in hydrophobia. One proving also showed an action on the bladder and urinary organs, producing excess of phosphates. A lady who took a decoction for four months steadily, was obliged to discontinue because it produced: Copious, corrosive, putrid leucorrhoea, causing great debility, tanning the inside of the thighs and staining linen yellow. She felt as if fire was running out of her. Terrible itching and smarting. Another prover had severe spinal and occipital pains; paresis of tongue and difficult deglutition.
