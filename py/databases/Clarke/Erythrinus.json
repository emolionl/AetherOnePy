    "Clinical" : [ "Pityriasis rubra. Syphilis." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Dr. Burnett is the authority for this medicine. He bases his use of it on an account of its effects on some sailors who ate the fish. They came out with a peculiar red rash which became chronic, and which the doctors took for a form of syphilis. Dr. Burnett cured with it a case of pityriasis rubra appearing in a large patch on the chest, and benefited other cases. He believes this form of skin affection to be a manifestation of syphilis in the second generation, the father of the patient he cured having had syphilis. Aurum muriaticum is the complementary remedy." ]
