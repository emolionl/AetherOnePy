    "Clinical" : [ "Chicken-pox. Eczema. Erysipelas. Skin, sensitive." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Murray Moore observed the effect of Rh. d. on three persons: (1) Miss M., of brown hair and fair complexion, walked up a hill one warm morning, and whilst perspiring gathered ferns which grew among the Rh. d. trees, the leaves of which she must have touched, though she did not pull any. The result was a very severe poisoning, which provided the majority of the symptoms of the Schema. (2) J. W., light-haired, robust Englishman, lay down whilst sweating among the bushes and was smartly poisoned. Ver. v. O internally and a lotion of Magnesia sulph. externally checked the spread of the disease. (3) Boy, pure blond type with thin, freckled skin, plucked some of the leaves, and in eighteen hours the poisoning symptoms came on, facial esysipelas with extreme oedema, closing both eyes, itching and burning. The symptoms became general. M. Moore relates also the case of a man who was poisoned in California in September and returned to the Eastern States and there had an annual eruption for six successive years. During the seventh attack he was carried off with pneumonia, which Moore thinks would not have been the case but for the Rhus complication. (C. D. P.)" ],
