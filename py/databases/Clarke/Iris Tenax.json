    "Characteristics" : [ "Dr. George Wigg, of Portland, Oregon, proved Iris tenax in the latter part of (Med. Adv. xvii. Amer. Hom., April, 1888; H. W., xxxv. 364). He published the proving under the name of Iris minor. This, as Heath has shown, is a local name only, its true botanical name being Iris tenax (H. W., xxx. 332). Dr. Wigg (aet. 44) took gtt. v. to 1x. of the strong tincture. A female prover took repeated doses of Ir. t. 2x and 3x. The order in which the symptoms occurred in Dr. Wigg's case is roughly as follows: In fifteen minutes burning in mouth and throat. This passed off in the night, but was intensified by each fresh dose. After the second dose, taken early next morning, the burning was reproduced, followed by dry mouth and absence of saliva in two hours. Then came the mental gloom and home-sick feeling, increasing towards midnight; headache in temples; toothache; sinking, all-gone feeling; itching and burning of scalp; abdominal pains; diarrhoea; desperate exhaustion compelling him to keep in bed; hard chill followed by rise of temperature. The acute pains in the bowels passed off in the night, but for fourteen days there was a tender spot over the ilio-caecal region, and the bowels did not act normally for ten days. The symptoms which Dr. Wigg considers most remarkable are: (1) Absence of saliva with dry mouth. (2) Gloomy, cast-down, home-sick feeling. (3) Burning in eyes without tears. (4) Pain in one tooth only (second upper molar). (5) Itching and burning of scalp without eruption. (6) Chill at p.m. (he never had a chill before or since). (7) Painful spot in ilio-caecal region and the length of time it lasted. It resembles Ir. vers. in producing bilious vomiting; burning sensations; and low spirits. In the female prover it produced a strange sensation in her mind: she thought some of her friends had died; the next day she was unusually cheerful. The most remarkable symptoms were, no doubt, the \"fearful pain in the ilio-caecal region\"; and the \"hard chill at p.m.\" These indications led to the cure of the two following cases: (1) Miss X, school teacher, had for several years a pain beginning in right eye, extending thence to right half of head. When the pain was most severe she vomited a quantity of green bile. When she did not vomit she had nausea, and a chill between and p.m. The pain passed off in sleep at night. It always began on Saturday, before rising. Ir. t. 30x every six hours, commencing Friday morning, was given, and quickly cured after Ir. v., Alo., Act. r., and Kali bi. had failed to give much relief. The relief from Ir. t. was so marked the patient thought she had received morphine. (2) Mr. E., after walking thirty miles over a mountainous country in August, while in a state of perspiration drank a large quantity of buttermilk. Four hours after he was taken with fearful pain in ileo-caecal region, which caused a deathly sensation at epigastrium. Finally he vomited much dark green bile without relief. An old-school doctor was called in and diagnosed obstruction with probable death in four days. He lingered three weeks and was brought home to Portland, where Dr. Wigg saw him, and diagnosed typhilitis, badly treated. Pressure on the ileo-caecal region caused death-like sensation at stomach-pit. Pain continued until he vomited a cupful of dark green bile. Somewhat constipated. Under Ir. t. 15x every three hours, he commenced to improve at once, and in two weeks was back at his business. Dr. Wigg noticed the all-gone feeling particularly on standing up, on waking in the morning. Cold water did not > burning in mouth and throat. Cold pillow > pain in temples. > By sucking in cold air (burning in mouth and throat). Hot applications > pain in bowels. Cup of tea > vomiting. Sweet oil and camphor > burning in mouth and throat. Many symptoms appear or are < on waking." ],
