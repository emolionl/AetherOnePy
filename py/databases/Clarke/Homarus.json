    "Characteristics" : [ "The effects of lobster on some persons and under some conditions are well known. In order to thoroughly study the effect A. M. Cushing adopted the happy idea of proving the specific lobster poison, and the result has been a very valuable addition to our armamentarium (H. R., iii. 98). Homarus is an agent of great activity, as the subjoined symptom list will show. Persons have been known to die after eating lobster and thereafter drinking milk. Cushing put a little of the poison into warm milk, and in ten minutes it was a hard mass. Papoid soon dissolved it, but pepsin took much longer. Cushing found that milk aggravated his symptoms during the proving. \"< From milk\" should be a strong indication for its use. The more prominent symptoms of the proving were: Sore throat, which was quite severe, felt dry, looked much inflamed with large blood-vessels, and appeared granulated headaches; deranged digestion; pains in back; sexual excitement disturbed sleep. Here is a peculiar symptom not unfrequently met with in dyspeptics: \"At p.m., ate a plain dinner, and at drank a little milk; at (midnight), after a few minutes' sleep awoke with hurried desire for stool, and was relieved by passing a large amount of wind. After much effort passed a large, long, tenacious stool.\" For patients who are awakened in the night by the necessity to pass wind, Hom. should be the remedy. Pains were sharp and sudden, compelling him to sit down. A curious sensation was: \"Felt as though could not move; on moving no pain; felt better by moving.\" On this indication, with others, Cushing cured a case with Hom. 4x. The patient had headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and when she awoke in the morning felt as if she could not move at all. On receiving Hom. there was a speedy restoration of keen appetite, both for food and work, and loss of headache and sore throat. Another cured case had the following symptoms: \"No appetite; distress in stomach; restless sleep; very tired in morning.\" A case of frequent \"bilious spells\" was also cured in a man who had had Nux and Dioscorea with only temporary relief. The symptoms generally are < after sleep; in the morning on waking; at night; on drawing a long breath; from drinking milk. > From motion; from passing wind; after eating; from inhaling cold air. L. H. Hallock relates (Med. Adv., xxii. 311) a personal experience. An hour after eating a small amount of lobster salad, general pruritus commenced, worse in lower extremities, especially the calves. The itching was of a biting, burning character, not > by rubbing or scratching, almost unendurable. It lasted two hours in spite of bathing with hot and cold water, fresh and salt. No sooner had the itching abated than lips, nose, eyes began to swell, till the eyes were closed and lips almost completely inverted. Throat swollen and oedematous so that it was almost impossible to breathe; profuse salivation. Eight hours after the meal he had the appearance of a severe and protracted debauch. In twenty-four hours was as well as ever. Once subsequently he had a like experience after eating lobster." ],
