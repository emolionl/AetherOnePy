    "Clinical" : [ "Cough, tickling. Phthisis. Night-sweats." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "H. R. (xii. 408) translates from Leip. Pop. Z. f. H., August, an article on the use of Salvia as a gargle in sore throat, and as a mouth wash in affections of the gums, but more especially in affections of the respiratory organs. The tickling cough of consumptives and the night-sweats were entirely relieved by doses of to drops in a tablespoonful of water. The H. R. translator adds this case: Mrs. X. had had for three weeks an irritating cough following an attack of pneumonia. The irritation being particularly great, he gave her, fresh from the garden, some Sage to chew, and the irritation was instantly relieved." ]
