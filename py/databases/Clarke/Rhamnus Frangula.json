    "Clinical" : [ "Anus, itching of. Appendicitis. Ardor urinae. Caecum, gurgling in. Diarrhoea. Flatulence. Urethritis. Vomiting." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "All parts of Rh. fr. appear to produce irritant and cathartic properties. The majority of the symptoms of the Schema were the result of the root bark, but the leaves were no less active. Stools of a dark-green colour were observed, copious, thin or pasty. With the stools there was much rumbling in the ileo-caecal region and along, the transverse colon with weakness after stool. (Rh. ca. has rumbling, griping, and cutting pains in ileo-caecal region.) There was more vomiting with Rh. fr. than with Rh. ca., and the former was abandoned as a cathartic because it so frequently produced vomiting instead. \"Burning in urethra while urinating and frequent micturition\" may prove an indication in gonorrhoea." ],
