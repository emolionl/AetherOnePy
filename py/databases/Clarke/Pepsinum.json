    "Clinical" : [ "Dyspepsia." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Pepsin. has been supposed to act purely as a digestive, but recent discoveries in regard to the action of the sarcodes makes this now scarcely tenable. Pepsin. may digest the contents of the stomach; but, like the secretions of other glands, it will in all probability act also, by its specific affinity, on the secretory tissues of the stomach itself." ]
