    "Characteristics" : [ "Cinchon. sul. has been extensively proved, but it appears to have been little used in practice, from having been overshadowed by the better known alkaloid, Chinin. sul. The general outline of symptoms is the same in both. Some of the most peculiar symptoms of Cinch. s. are the following: Bursting headache on waking. Pain in anterior lobe of cerebrum, as though a net were drawn through the whole substance of the brain. Darkness before the eyes on exerting them. Sensation as if the throat were burnt with hot drink. Cold feeling at pit of stomach. Pasty taste; and pasty stools. The sexual organs are excited: voluptuous dreams and painful erections at night. Menses a week too soon and more copious than usual. The chest seems hollow and distended so that breathing seems especially easy. Many symptoms of fever are present; and there is recurrence of symptoms. Sweat between shoulder-blades in the night, followed by itching. Symptoms < after eating; by motion. Weariness, sleepiness, general aching; especially in eyes, ears, and genitals." ],
