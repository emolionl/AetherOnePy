    "Clinical" : [ "Delirium tremens. Paralysis. Paralysis agitans. Tremor. Writer's cramp." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "The name Darnel means stupefied, and the plant's evil reputation is of very ancient date. The symptoms are the result of observations made on persons poisoned by eating meal containing an admixture of Lol. tem. Allen mentions an assertion that Lolium is much infested with ergot, and that it is to this that the poisoning symptoms are due, the unaffected grain being inert; and Allen notes in support of this that the poisonings have been most frequently observed in low, wet districts, and during wet seasons. Provings are needed to decide this. The chief symptoms are: Confusion of mind, at times delirium; very great depression. Nausea and vomiting of the bread containing it and mucus with it. Paralysis, tremors, and convulsions. Cold rigors, internal chilliness; cold sweat. A very characteristic symptom is: Tightness in the calves; violent pain in the calves as if bound with cords. This tightness affects the rest of the legs in less degree. Bonino has cured a carpenter, who had had trembling of the hands eleven years, < morning. Latterly the legs also began to tremble. His father and brother were similarly affected. Merc. v. and Agar. only relieved temporarily. Lot. tem. cured." ],
