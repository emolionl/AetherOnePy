    "Characteristics" : [ "Levico has a high reputation among health resorts for nervous and skin cases, favouring assimilation and increasing nutrition. Burnett is the only homoeopathic authority. He says \"Levico in to drop doses is a valuable intercurrent help in grave cases where there is much debility, notably after the searching remedies such as Bacillinum.\" Levico is supplied in two strengths, the strong and the weak. Either may be used in the doses indicated by Dr. Burnett, which is much smaller than that usually prescribed." ]
