    "Characteristics" : [ "Phenacet. belongs to the Aniline group, and was introduced into old-school practice as a remedy in febrile states and neuralgias, free from the dangers of Antfeb., Antipyr., Exalg., &c. Though not so dangerous as these, it is not free from ill effects. These have been well summed up by F. G. Oehme (H. R., xv. 506), and I have put them in Schema form, and added a symptom observed by myself on a young lady who had taken Phenacet. for headaches: A circumscribed rash on both cheeks which came out red, lasted four days and then peeled, and as soon as it was clear the process was repeated. I tried many remedies with varying success, but it finally disappeared under Alm. one powder at bedtime." ],
