    "Clinical" : [ "Vertigo." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Culex was proved by Dr. Kent, but the only verification I have found is of this symptom: vertigo every time he blows his nose. W. P. Wesselhoeft cured a man, forty, stout, thickset, light brunette, who had swelling on upper jaw over first right tricuspid. Slight redness of cheek. Abscess threatened, with paroxysmal throbbing, dull pain. > By warm applications. Came on after exposure to wet weather. Merc. sol. and Rhus did no good. The patient then said that whenever he blew his nose he had vertigo, with a sense of fulness in the ears. Culex promptly relieved the pain, and in forty-eight hours the swelling had gone. It might be well to prove a tincture of specimens of Anopheles well charged with malarial organisms." ]
