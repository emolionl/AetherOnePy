    "Characteristics" : [ "Aq. mar. has been principally used (in high potencies) for the effects of residence near the sea (as biliousness, constipation, headache, &c.). It has been used in wineglassful doses and also in potencies as a remedy for sea-sickness. It has been proved by C. Wesselhoeft. Among the symptoms were: Neuralgic pains down right temple and forehead. Faceache left side; cold water intolerable. Sensation of a hair or fishbone in throat, tickling and urging to swallow, causing cough, which does not relieve. Pain on swallowing, extending to ear and temples. Nausea; and nauseous sensation in stomach and abdomen. This symptom seems peculiar: \"Constant hawking and raising of phlegm, tough and white like cotton.\" The leading indication for it is: < at seaside; or on the sea." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Compare: Nat. mur., Chlorum (but in addition to its chief ingredient, sea-water contains in solution every inorganic substance in the world); also Silica marina." ]
