    "Characteristics" : [ "Belonging to the Compositae, and closely allied to Erigeron and the Groundsel family (Senecio), \"Fireweed\" (so called because it grows abundantly in clearings which have been burnt out) has been used empirically in haemorrhages, especially metrorrhagia, and as a local application in skin affections, herpes, eczema, psoriasis, and indolent ulcers. A short proving has shown an action over the circulatory apparatus, producing flushes of heat which suddenly give way to coldness. Another marked feature is increased appetite; and also increased feeling of strength and desire for exercise. According to Hale, \"Oil of Fireweed\" is also extracted from Erigeron, and is said by chemists to be identical with turpentine. All three cause active and passive haemorrhages, the former being the primary and the latter the secondary action. Erech. is indicated in haemorrhages of bright red blood from nose, mouth, bowels, kidneys, uterus, and lungs. These are attended with excitement of the circulation. It is also indicated in passive haemorrhages of dark fluid blood. Hale also commends it in gonorrhoea and orchitis." ],
