    "Characteristics" : [ "The symptoms of Calc. acet. (the first of the lime preparations proved by Hahnemann) are in the main identical with those of Calc. carb. (both being prepared from oyster shells), and are included in the pathogenesis of that medicine. Among its most marked symptoms may be named: Vertigo when walking in the open air. Stupefying, pressive pains in the forehead with compression of the whole head and obscuration of the senses whilst reading: he was obliged to stop while reading and did not know where he was. Clotar Muller cured many cases of megrim with Calc. acet. The indications he relied on were: \"Sour taste in mouth, sour eructations, sensation of coldness in the head, and of emptiness. Pain one-sided, affecting right eye, which was red, causing lachrymation.\" Sour, offensive eructations. Profuse, painless, not exhausting diarrhoea. Severe itching of anus. Allen (Handbook) mentions that it has cured some marked cases of membranous dysmenia and also of violent spasmodic cough ending in the expulsion of casts of bronchial tubes. For comparisons see Calc. c. It has been used in the excruciating pains of open cancer (compare Calc. oxal.)." ]
