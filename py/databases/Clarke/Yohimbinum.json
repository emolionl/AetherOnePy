It is a powerful stimulant of the genital function in males. In animals it causes increased liveliness and cheerfulness, hyperaemia of the conjunctiva, heat and redness of the ears, and of the nose also in dogs. Lambreghts (J. Belge d'H., viii. 188) relates the case of a young man, \"thin, anaemic, nervous, and partially impotent, \", who took a 5-mgr. tablet one morning, another in the evening, and a third the following, morning. The symptoms of the Schema are his, and they were so severe that he discontinued the drug in spite of a certain amelioration of the sexual neurasthenia. Yohim. set up symptoms of fever, disordered the digestion, caused agitation and tremors, and increased the action of the heart. Eulenburg (Deut. Wed. Woch., April quoted B. M. J.) used Yohim. in 10-drop doses of a per cent. solution, and in 5-mgr. tablets, \"in cases of neurasthenic impotence with excellent results.\" Yohim. should be a homoeopathic remedy in priapism and congestive states of the sexual organs." ],
