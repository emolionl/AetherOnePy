    "Characteristics" : [ "A remarkable proving of Menth. pip. was made by Demeures, who took a single drop of the tincture, the effects of which lasted into the third month. A case of fatal poisoning with the essence is on record. The patient, a boy of six, took between and ounces and died in two hours. When seen he was insensible, eyes fixed, pupils unmovable, stertorous breathing, cold skin, lips livid. The most remarkable symptom of the proving was the cough, and this has been fully confirmed. It was a dry cough, excited by air entering larynx, by reading aloud, by exposure to cold, by shocks of any kind. Demeures says he cured with Menth. pip. every case of influenza that came under his care in the winter of 1847-8. \"It is to dry cough, however caused, what Arn. is to injuries and Aco. to inflammatory complaints. It relieves even the cough of consumptives.\" A single globule of the 30th sufficed. Demeures gave it to singers a short time before singing, and it greatly helped them to hold the voice. After the proving Demeures found that he could rise earlier than usual and yet feel bright and fresh, whereas before it he could not. Gibson Miller (J. of Hcs., v. 34) relates this case: Teacher, since whooping-cough in boyhood had a dry, spasmodic cough, < in cold weather. The inhalation of the smallest quantity of smoke, either of coal, wood, or tobacco, at once induced a most distressing paroxysm. < By the least breath of air or any fog. Scarcely any expectoration. Husky on attempting to sing. Menth. pip. completely removed the cough and enabled him to sit in a room full of tobacco smoke and sing with clearness. Hansen commends it in", "Bilious colic with great accumulation of gas; severe pain of shingles; and as an external remedy in pruritus vaginae.", "The symptoms were < rising, > lying down in bed. > Whilst eating. < Cold air; smoke; reading aloud; stooping; turning head; writing." ],
