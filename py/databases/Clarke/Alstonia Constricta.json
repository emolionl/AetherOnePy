Dr. Dietz, who has tested it clinically, gives the following as leading indications: Debility from lack of digestive power in the stomach or general assimilative power. Tongue generally has a dirty white coat, especially at base; though it may be clean. It has no relation to purely nervous debility. The nausea is < morning, before breakfast, or at irregular times, especially when depending on reflex irritation from disturbance of pelvic organs. An empty, gone feeling in stomach or whole abdomen at irregular times; generally with tearing, dragging-down sensation in hypogastrium, as if everything would escape from the vulva. Pale face, flushing on least excitement. Food seems to remain in stomach a long time undigested. Diarrhoea of undigested food immediately after eating; has to leave table before finishing a meal. (This symptom was cured by Alston. c. 1x in a patient who had taken much iron, after the failure of Puls., Sep., Sul., Sil., Nat. m.) Leucorrhoea and bearing-down < by walking.
