    "Characteristics" : [ "The alkaloids of Hydrastis have been largely used in the old school as remedies for internal haemorrhage. Hydrastin. was found to be inconvenient by reason of its irritant properties. Hydrastinin., a modification of Hydrastin., proved to he free from this drawback, and its use in fibroid tumours has been advocated by Dr. Burford and others in the homoeopathic school. A case of central uterine fibroid tumour under my care, about the size of a large orange, and pressing on the bladder, causing bladder symptoms, was quickly reduced in size with the disappearance of all troublesome symptoms by Hydrastinin. 3x." ]
