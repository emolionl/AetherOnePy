    "Clinical" : [ "Bladder, affections of. Penis, pains in." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Hering is the authority for this medicine. Only one symptom has been recorded, but it is very definite. Tearing, jerking pains, which instantly unfit him for everything; seem to shoot from deep within the abdomen, below the umbilicus to the end of the urethra. As soon as he eats anything they return; then he is obliged to lie down. They are like electric shocks, excessively severe, and always occur twice in succession." ]
