    "Clinical" : [ "Ankles, pains in. Rheumatic fever. Wrists, pains in." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Trimethyl., which is prepared from herring-brine among other sources, has a very unpleasant and penetrating fish-like odour. At one time it was regarded as a panacea in cases of acute rheumatism. Experiments on patients and others show that it diminishes the amount of urea excreted. Hansen gives these as characteristics: great pains in wrist-joints, also great restlessness, pains in ankle-joints from standing < slight movement. C. Carleton Smith (H. P., vi. 432) gives these: \"Rheumatism, when the needle held in the fingers gets so heavy she cannot sew.\" \"Copious diarrhoea with pains in ankle-joints but not in wrists; thirst for large quantities of cold water (like Bry.).\"" ]
