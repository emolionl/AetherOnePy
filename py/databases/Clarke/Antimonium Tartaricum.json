    "Characteristics" : [ "Antim. tart. resembles closely Antim. crud. and the other Antimonies in its action, though the modalities differ. Antim. tart. was the favourite emetic of olden times, and consequently it is one of our best remedies in states of nausea. The nausea is as intense as that of Ipec., but less persistent, and is > by vomiting. Nash has found it the nearest thing to a specific in cholera morbus, the indications being \"nausea, vomiting, loose stools, prostration, cold sweat, stupor, or drowsiness.\" In chest affections of all kinds it is indicated where there is great accumulation of mucus with coarse rattling and inability to raise it. Drowsiness and even coma may accompany cases of all kinds in which Ant. t. is called for. The face is pale or cyanotic and the breathing stertorous. There is heat about heart and warmth rising up from it. A sensation of coldness in the blood-vessels. A correspondent of the Chemist and Druggist (May 1892) related the case of an apprentice who had been employed for a week making up \"cough-balls\" and diuretic balls for horses, both containing powdered antimony. He had been cautioned not to inhale the powder, but his employer believes he did. At the end of the week he was seized with an illness, due, his employer thinks, and no doubt correctly, to the antimony. The symptoms are very characteristic. First, there was nausea, lassitude, and a desire for sleep. He was sent to bed, and during the night his fellow apprentice said he got up and struggled to relieve himself of an imaginary load on the chest. On being put to bed again, a profuse perspiration broke out, and also a peculiar rash on his face and chest; after that he vomited freely and felt better. Temperature pulse A fever-mixture of liq. ammon. acet. and Sp. aether. nit. was given. A doctor who was called in found undoubted symptoms of pneumonia of left lung, but confessed he had never seen the rash before and would not venture an opinion regarding it. For two days the temperature kept at then both temperature and the pulse became normal, the rash disappeared, and with it the pneumonic cough; in six days the boy was perfectly well. \"A child coughs when angry\" is characteristic. Heath cured a case of whooping-cough in a child who was very fretful before the cough. The mother said that if the child got angry she immediately had a fit of coughing. \"Cough at a.m.\" is another indication which I have found true. Further leading indications for this remedy are: attacks of fainting, internal trembling. It causes relaxation of sphincters and muscles, with nausea or without. Os uteri dry, tender, undilatable, with distress, moaning, and restlessness with every pain (Aco.), feeling of sickness. Convulsive twitching. Convulsions. Great heaviness in all the limbs and great debility. Rheumatic pains (fever), with perspiration, which does not relieve. Inflammation of internal organs. Gastric and bilious complaints. Constant nausea", "nausea felt in chest (Puls.). Sensation of weight or heaviness in many parts; head, occiput, coccyx, limbs. Pulsations in all the blood-vessels. The child wants to be carried and cries if any one touches it. Peevishness, whining, and crying. Inquietude, apprehension, agitation. Dulness and bewilderment of head as if benumbed. Chronic trembling of head; of head and hands (as in paralysis agitans). The tongue has a thick, white, pasty coat with red papillae showing through. Intense nausea and vomiting with great effort; with perspiration on forehead. Fulness and sensation of stones in abdomen especially when sitting bent forward. The skin is notably affected. The typical eruption is like that of small-pox, the symptoms of which disease are so closely reproduced in the proving that it has been used instead of vaccine for inoculation purposes, and prophylactic power has been claimed for it. (Compare Variolinum.) The terrible backache of small-pox is paralleled by the back-pains of Ant. t., which I have found to correspond to more cases of lumbago than any other remedy. Ant. t. is also a \"sycotic, \", and I have verified a symptom given in Hering, \"warts at the back of the glans penis.\" Antim. tart. has < by warmth, but not the excessive sensitiveness to heat and sun of Ant. c., and some of the rheumatic symptoms are > by warmth. Warm drink < cough, also lying in bed, especially becoming warm there. There is also < from cold and damp, but not the ill effects of cold washing found in Ant. crud. Also cold washing > the rheumatic toothache of Ant. t. Both have < from touch and even from being looked at. Ant. t. has < on sitting down; when seated; and on rising from a seat; < sitting bent forward; > sitting erect. < Lying on side affected. < Motion, on every effort to move. A characteristic of Ant. t. in lung affections is \"lies with head back.\" There is not the > from rest which is apparent in many symptoms of Ant. c. The Ant. t. headache is < by rest; also earache and respiration. < At night is more marked with Ant. t. than Ant. c. Cough is < a.m. > from eructations." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Compare: Acon. (croup); Aethus. c. and Ipec. (expression of nausea); Am. c.; Arsen. (asthma, heart symptoms, gastric catarrh); Bry. (pneumonia < l., Ant. t. < r., -chest, and brain symptoms after retrocession of eruption", "Bry., measles and scarlatina; Ant. t. small-pox). Laches. (dyspnoea on waking); Lyc (catarrh of chest, flapping of nostrils.", "Ant. t. has nostrils dilated); Verat. (colic, vomiting, coldness, craving for acids", "Ant. t. has more jerks, drowsiness, urging to urinate; Ver. more cold sweat and fainting); Op. (cough with drowsiness and yawning); Sang. c. (pneumonia, face livid); Ipec. (Ant. t. has more drowsiness and tendency of lungs to collapse); Thuja (effects of vaccination when Thuja fails and Silic is not indicated. Ant. t. develops small-pox pustule; Thuja dries it up). Compatible: Phos. in hydrocephaloid, worn-out constitutions, laryngitis, pneumonia. Follows well: Silic. in dyspnoea from foreign substances in larynx; Puls. (nausea in chest, gonorrhoeal suppressions); Tereb. (symptoms from damp cellars); Variolinum. Antidoted by: Asaf., Chi., Coccul., Con. (pustules on genitals), Ipec., Lauro., Op. (Opium in large doses is the best antidote in poisoning), Puls., Sep. It antidotes: Baryt. c., Bry. (dyspepsia), Camph., Caust. (dyspepsia), Puls. Ant. t. differs from Mercury in producing a purely local action on the mouth similar to its action on the skin. The action of Merc. on the mouth is indirect." ],
