    "Characteristics" : [ "K. n. is known in old-school practice principally as a \"refrigerant diuretic, \", and as the active agent in the well-known \"nitre papers, \", which are burnt for producing fumes to allay attacks of asthma. It has also been used in rheumatism, and for incontinence of urine in children. It has been extensively proved by homoeopaths, and symptoms have been added from cases of poisoning, so that its characteristics are well defined. It is almost equal to K. ca. in producing stitching pains; and it is like it in having a cough at a.m. The pains produced by K. n. are very severe", "stitching, cutting, lancinating, tearing, and pressing. And there is, as with many other Kalis, much external sensitiveness", "of scalp; of abdomen; of testes. That its anti-asthmatic properties are homoeopathic is abundantly shown in the respiratory symptoms it produces. Its \"diuretic\" properties are utilised homoeopathically in diabetes insipidus, and its use in enuresis must come in the same category. K. n. acts with great intensity on the abdominal and pelvic organs, producing most painful colics, diarrhoea, and dysentery; in the male sexual sphere, excitement and pain in testes and cords; in the female, menorrhagia with flow of ink-like blackness. This is very characteristic. Another characteristic of K. n. is < from eating veal, or effects of eating it", "headache, diarrhoea, &c. The mental state of K. n. is chiefly one of peevishness, fretfulness, and ennui. There are many curious symptoms in the nose: \"The pain-like contraction in the eyes, forehead, and face concentrates in the tip of the nose\"; \"Swollen feeling in right nostril, which is painful on pressure\" sore pain in upper part of right nostril with external sensitiveness these two last symptoms led to the cure of a large nasal polypus in a girl. In a poisoning case there was in the period of recovery intense vertigo with tinnitus, which should indicate K. n. in some cases of Meniere's disease. Easy intoxication by wine or beer was noted by several provers. A peculiar symptom is a sour taste in the throat. Another peculiar symptom is in connection with the asthmatic state. The breathlessness is so great that the patient though thirsty can only drink a sip at a time between the breaths. Allen thus defines the asthma of K. n.: Asthma with excessive dyspnoea, faintness and nausea, with dull stitches or with burning pain in chest, rather free expectoration. A solution of saltpetre as an application was an old remedy for inveterate mange in cats. Nitre with Sulphur and Charcoal forms gunpowder. A teaspoonful of this in hot water was a favourite remedy for gonorrhoea among soldiers in the days when black powder was used. In the lower triturations gunpowder has cured ascarides in adults. In some experiments made by myself with gunpowder 2x, severe herpes facialis involving right eyebrow and right side of nose was developed. The most characteristic < is from veal; < from wine or beer, < from a slight draught of air (headache). < After washing in cold water (eye). < a.m. (cough). < Lying with head low (dyspnoea), < in morning; afternoon; evening; after midnight. Walking < many symptoms. < Breathing; < by coffee. > Lying down; lying right side; uncovering head (pain in parietal region). Suited to: asthmatic constitutions and chest complaints." ],
    "Relations" : [ "Antidoted by: Smelling Nit. sp. dul. Ipec. relieved the cough. Smelling Camph. intensified the sufferings. Follows well: Aco. in dysentery, and is followed well by Nux in the same. Also follow well: Bell., Calc., Puls., Rhus, Sep. K. n. antidotes the renal symptoms of Caust.
