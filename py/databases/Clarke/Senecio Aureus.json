    "Characteristics" : [ "The Golden Ragwort had a reputation in domestic and eclectic practice as a regulator of menstrual functions when Hale introduced it into homoeopathic practice. A. E. Small and others proved it, and clinical additions have filled out the picture. Like many other Compositae, the Ragworts, or Groundsels, have power over haemorrhagic conditions, whether arising from disease or from wounds. The haemorrhagic function of menstruation comes particularly under the influence of Senec. A very definite relation has been traced between the nose and the female sexual organs, and Senec. is indicated when epistaxis or nasal catarrh takes the place of menses when suppressed from any cause. The menses may be profuse and early, or they may be retarded or absent. Senec. may be required in a great variety of conditions traceable to non-appearing menses. C. M. Foss (A. H., xxii. 12) reports the case of Miss L., who had seen no period for fifteen months. She was chlorotic, had a dry, hacking cough, with frequent pulse, made still more frequent by any excitement; headache, poor sleep, constipation. The abdomen had been gradually enlarging for six months, and tapping had been decided upon when Senec. 1x was given. All symptoms rapidly cleared up, and the menses returned within a short time. Senec. 1x also cured a girl, who had suppression of urine in addition to chlorosis, ascites, and suppressed menses (M. A., xxiii. 77). S. H. Talcott (quoted A. M., xxiv. 188) reports an important case bearing on the same point. Mrs. X., mother of two children. Before confinement the patient was haunted with the idea that her child would be stillborn. Nine days after its birth, strong and healthy, she was admitted to hospital in a state of violent acute mania, which continued, with high temperature, for three months. With great physical activity, the mental state was that of a wild, violent, and almost uncontrollable person. There was severe pain in the head, great nervous irritability and sleeplessness and hysterical erethism. These symptoms, coupled with the fact (now first ascertained) that the lochia had ceased suddenly after confinement, and the menses had not come on, led to the choice of Senec., which was given in drop doses of the 3x every two hours. Steady improvement resulted, and after a few weeks the patient was allowed out on parole. A relapse followed, and Bell. did no good. Senec. was again given with good effect, and complete recovery took place. Talcott regards Senec. as midway between the pugilistic state of Bell. and the tearful state of Puls. He remarks that recovery from puerperal mania seldom occurs unless menstruation is re-established. Hale notes that the country people call Senec. \"Wild Valerian, \", and use it for nervousness, hysteria, low spirits, sleeplessness, especially in women; and he refers to this \"globus\" symptom of the pathogenesis: \"About the middle of the afternoon, sensation as if a ball was in the stomach, rising up into the throat, lasting for about an hour; sensation of tightness in the throat, with a disposition to attempt to relieve it by swallowing. Talcott's case becomes more significant in the light of Cooper's observation of the brain action of Sen. Jacobaea. Small, who proved Senec., records this case: Woman, had been ill six weeks, the symptoms steadily, increasing till the following picture was presented: Face bloated, abdomen enlarged, feet oedematous; urine alternately profuse and watery, or dark and scanty; frequent desire to urinate day and night. Senec. O, gtt. x, three times a day, cured quickly. Small remarks that he has found Senec. useful in the dysuria of women and children when evidently of catarrhal origin; and in dysuria with uterine displacement. Mucous sediment in the urine is an indication. But the benefits of Senec. are not confined to the female sex. Small relates this case: Man, nervo-sanguine, subject of renal inflammation affecting right kidney generally, causing intense pain, febrile disturbance, prostration. On one occasion the pain was particularly intense, and the bladder seemed implicated. Every time he passed water he cried out in agony. Urine reddish; very hot and acrid. Bowels constipated. Dull headache; mouth and throat dry; chilly, fever, and perspiration. Senec. O, gtt. xx, in half a tumbler of water; a dessertspoonful every hour. There was relief from the first dose, and the pain soon subsided entirely, leaving the patient freed from recurrence of the attacks. Senec. has caused: \"Dull, heavy pain in left spermatic cord, moving along cord to testicle. Prostatic gland enlarged, feels hard and swelled to touch. Lascivious dreams, with pollutions.\" Hale says he has found Senec. useful in advanced stages of gonorrhoea, and in prostatic disorders. Hale reports the following case of dysmenorrhoea: Mrs. X., mother of one child, had had an abortion three years before, and another (at the second month of pregnancy) four months before Hale saw her. Since the last abortion she had suffered from painful menstruation, which had not been the case previously. Menses every three weeks, profuse, lasting eight or nine days, accompanied by much cutting pain in sacrum, hypogastrium, and groins. Pale, weak, nervous; slight cough, generally at night. Senec. O, gtt. v, was given three times a day till the next period, which came on at the twenty-ninth day, and was perfectly normal in quantity and without pain. Senec. has a place in coughs and even in phthisis. \"It is especially serviceable in mucous coughs, \", says Hale. \"In chronic coughs, catarrhal affections, haemoptysis, incipient phthisis attended with troublesome cough, the result of obstructed menstruation, \", it has a well-established reputation. Peculiar Sensations of Senec. are: As of a wave from occiput to sinciput. As if he would pitch forward. As of a ball rising from stomach to throat. Respiration as if greatly fatigued. Pains are radiating, shifting, lancinating. Symptoms alternate. Senec. is specially Suited to: women and little girls of nervous temperament. Lyman Watkins (quoted H. W., xxxiv. 300) says, \"Females taking Senec. generally improve in health and strength, accumulate flesh, become light-hearted and cheerful. This may be due to some tonic influence.\" The symptoms are < at night (cough; sweat; sleeplessness; frequent micturition). < In afternoon (general). < In open air. Very sensitive to open air; tendency to catarrhs. Colic is > bending forward; and > by stool. > At onset of menses. < Sitting; must keep moving about (mind)." ],
