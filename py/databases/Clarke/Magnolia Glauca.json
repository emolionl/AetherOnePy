    "Clinical" : [ "Asthma. Fainting." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Our knowledge of Mag. gl. is based on two observations by S. A. Jones and T. F. Allen of the effects of the flowers on three persons. The symptoms were these: \"Sense of great oppression about his chest;\" \"strong tendency to fainting (these occurred in a man). A lady had: \"Oppression of chest; could not expand the lungs; with a feeling as if she had swallowed food without chewing, and it distressed her stomach.\" In a doctor it \"increased the pain of inflammatory gout;\" and \"evidently increased the paroxysm of a pain which came on every afternoon.\" The Treasury of Botany says: \"M. glauca is a low-growing, deciduous tree, called in America Swamp Sassafras, from the nature of the locality in which it grows, and from the resemblance in its properties to Laurus sassafras. It is also called Beaver-tree, because the root is eaten by beavers, which animals also make use of the wood in constructing their nests.\"" ]
