    "Characteristics" : [ "The pathogenesis of Hcyan. ac. is mainly composed of symptoms observed in poisoning cases and clinically verified, but it has also been proved by Joerg and his pupils. Hcn. is one of the deadliest and most rapidly acting of poisons. Hence its applicability in cases of critical intensity, such as the collapse stage of cholera, when it supervenes on sudden cessation of all discharges; convulsion during severe attacks of illness. It acts powerfully on the coeliac ganglia, causing intestinal cramps and colics. Convulsions and paralysis are the leading notes of the medicine's action. In the convulsions the body is stiffened and thrown back; cramp in nape of neck is very characteristic; breathing comes in paroxysms; jaws set; foaming at mouth; face flushed, bluish tint. A. H. Croucher cured a boy, 1/2, of convulsions. First attack occurred six months previously. His father's sister had died of epilepsy. Before the fits came on he could walk well, but could not afterwards. The fits occurred at intervals of about three weeks when a succession of them occurred, each lasting about five minutes, during two or three days. During the intervals between the fits he would generally scream. In the morning on awaking, patient cried out, then convulsions occurred; body and limbs convulsed, eyelids twitched but remained open, eyeballs turned up and to right. Seemed quite unconscious. Hcn. 2x, one drop three times a day, increased afterwards to two drops and continued for a fortnight. No more convulsions, but three months later a rash developed all over him.", "The characteristic blue tint of Hcn. is apparent after death in some poisoning cases: livid spots on limbs; nails violet. In one case there was a brilliant violent hue all over. The tetanic spasm of Hcn. is persistent and tonic, and has none of the reflex excitability of the Nux state. Hcn. acts most powerfully on the muscles of face, jaws, and back; the risus sardonicus is pronounced; lividity; frothing. It acts on the medulla and through the vagus nerve on heart and respiration. The breathing is irregular and gasping. The heart is greatly disturbed; blueness and coldness of surface; pulse feeble, imperceptible. The patient clutches at the heart as if in distress. The prostration of Hcn. is profound: drinks roll audibly into the stomach. It cured a boy of four of fever who had this symptom: \"when swallowing a teaspoonful of liquid it sounds like water rolling into an empty barrel.\" Paralysis attacks first the lower, then the upper limbs. A dry tearing cough < at night is among the symptoms of Hcn.; and it relieves a similar cough often met with in consumptives. For it must not be imagined that the remedy is only of use in desperate cases of acute illness; it answers to its minute individual symptoms just as truly as does Camph., but it is only those who know the drug in the higher as well as the lower attenuations who will be able to profit by a knowledge of these. \"Feels as if a cloud were going over his brain, \", is a symptom Cash removed with Hcn. in a case of sunstroke. There is much disturbance of the digestion, which is < after eating. The headache is < at night and the vertigo < in the open air. Coldness is a great feature with the remedy, marble coldness within and without. Blue tinge of the skin is also characteristic." ],
