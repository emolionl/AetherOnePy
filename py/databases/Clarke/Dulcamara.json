    "Characteristics" : [ "The leading indication for the homoeopathic use of Dulcamara is found in its modality, \"< from cold and damp.\" Any condition which has this feature may find its remedy in Dulc. Effects of lying on damp ground (e.g., paralysis); conditions which are < in cold, damp weather; or, from changes from hot to cold weather, especially if sudden. Phlegmatic, torpid, scrofulous patients, who are restless and irritable and who take cold on damp changes, are especially suited for Dulc. Sensitiveness to cold and damp runs through the Solanaceae, and is marked in Bell. and Caps., but it is supreme in Dulc. This feature among others renders them all good antidotes to Mercurius. Baryta carb, is the complement of Dulc. in \"< from cold weather, especially in scrofulous children.\" In poisoning cases Dulc. produces: Hard, griping pains in bowels; unconsciousness; tetanic spasm; trismus; loud, rattling breathing; death. Paralyses are numerous: paralysis of tongue; of lungs; of heart (pneumogastric paralysis). (I once gave Dulc. with complete relief to the pain, in a case of sarcoma of the bones at the base of the skull, in which there were stabbing pains in the front of the head, and partial paralysis of the tongue. It was the latter symptom which determined the choice of the remedy.) Paralysis of the bladder. Rheumatic paralyses. Paralysed part feels icy cold. One-sided spasms. Convulsions beginning in face. Trembling, especially of right arm. It cured: \"Paralysis of vocal cords (aphonia) from sleeping over a damp cellar.\" McLaren cured with a single dose the following case, which was the result of a wetting: Facial paralysis (l.) following neuralgia, the eye having remained unclosed for eight months. Red rash with itching < in damp weather. After a slight aggravation improvement began in two weeks and continued steadily (Med. Adv., xviii. 214). Dulc. is a scrofulous remedy and has many scrofulous-looking eruptions: moist or dry, red, tettery eruptions, especially on face; furfuraceous; herpetic; urticaria; skin callous; warts, fleshy or large, smooth. Painless ulcers. (Dulc. cured in two doses a rash like mosquito-stings appearing every month before the menses, < when warm; compelled to sit where it is cold.) It corresponds to results of repercussed eruptions. Offensive sweat; effects of sudden cooling whilst sweating. Dropsical affections. Catarrhal troubles. Dryness of mucous membranes strongly indicate it. Dulc. causes diarrhoea, and a characteristic form is when there is vomiting with the stool. It causes a mucous-like sediment in the urine and is particularly indicated when a muco-purulent urine is associated with general one-sided sensitiveness, especially of the abdomen. (Amer. Hom., xxi. 317), records the cure with six doses of Dulc. of the following case: A prison-warder had difficulty with urine four years; frequent micturition, dribbling a few drops. Stains linen yellow. < Afternoon; in damp cold weather. Some pain over left kidney and left iliac region; > after moving about or in warm weather. Sweats easily and often takes cold, when he suffers from sore-throat. Dislikes sweets.) Pains in many parts, as if from cold. Bruised feeling. Sensations: as of a board pressing against forehead; as if head were enlarged; as if hair stood on end; as if fire were darting out of eyes; as if worms were crawling up and down in abdomen; biting in rectum as from salt; as if lung moved in waves; as if arms were of wood; as of needles over whole body. Crawling, tickling itching of various parts; of tip of tongue. < Lying on back; > lying on side. < Stooping, > erect. < Bending diseased part backward. Most symptoms < at rest and > by motion. Most symptoms are < evening and night. Warmth > most symptoms, but < cough and nettle-rash. < Cold air; cold change of weather; damp weather; getting wet; using water. < From cold drinks; from ice-creams. Skin eruptions are sensitive to touch; pressure >. Small furuncles appear on places hurt by concussion." ],
