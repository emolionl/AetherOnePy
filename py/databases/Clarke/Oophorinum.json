    "Characteristics" : [ "On the analogy of the action of Thyroidin in myxoedema, Ooph. has been used with much success in cases of suffering following excision of the ovaries, and for the climacteric sufferings of women. I have had good results with it in such cases in the lower triturations. It has been suggested as a remedy in ovarian cysts. E. Saalfeld (quoted H.
