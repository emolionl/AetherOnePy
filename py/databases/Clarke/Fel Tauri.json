    "Characteristics" : [ "Ox gall is a remedy of very ancient use. It is used in the old-school mostly as a purgative; for preventing putrefactive changes in the intestines, and for increasing peristalsis. It is sometimes given along with Opium to prevent the constipating effect of that drug. In the stomach bile is a foreign body, precipitating pepsin and causing irritation of the stomach. It does not aid the digestion either of albumen or of farinaceous substances. Fel. t. has been proved homoeopathically by Buchner, and has produced a few characteristic symptoms: disordered digestion, diarrhoea, headache, pains in joints, and cramps. It removed a tendency to sleep after eating. Several symptoms were noticed in nape of neck." ],
