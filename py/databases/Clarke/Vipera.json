    "Characteristics" : [ "The effects of bites by the Common Viper and related species have been collected, and have furnished the data for Homoeopathic prescribing. Vipera affects the blood and blood-vessels, conducing to haemorrhage and inflammation of the vessels themselves. A keynote for Vip. in cases of phlebitis and varicosis is \"< on letting the limb affected hang down\"; as if it would burst with fulness. The region of the vessel affected is inflamed and sensitive. Allen (Handbook) relates this case: A goldbeater found the veins of his right arm become exceedingly swollen and painful, so that he could no longer work, or let his hand hang down. Vip. cured immediately. A case (quoted from Med. Adv. in Med. Cent., ii. 79) of varicose vein of the popliteal space, with the sensation as though the leg would burst, and a nervous, fidgety condition of the feet which kept them in constant motion, was cured with Vip. torva The bursting feeling appears to be at the root of this characteristic. Swan said Vip. was a remedy for all forms of epistaxis. Vip. has a chronic and periodic action; the symptoms return annually for years. Patients resist the cold badly. The parts may be paralysed and ulcers and gangrene follow. A Sensation as if something ran up the thigh occurred in the bitten limb in one case. In one case there was sweat over the whole body except the bitten limb. Leonard (M. A., xxvi. 103) gave Vipera acontica carinata (1) to a lady suffering from climacteric haemorrhage; flow red with dark clots; excessive to prostration and faintness. She had a small uterine fibroid. A few doses relieved, and the excessive haemorrhage did not return. (2) A lady nursing a child a year old was much prostrated by haemorrhage lasting several weeks, not profuse, but continuous: Nose-bleed nearly every day; weaning brought no relief. Chi. did no good. Vip. ac. cm cured in three doses. The symptoms are: < By touch; by pressure; on change of weather. < Letting limb or part hang down." ],
