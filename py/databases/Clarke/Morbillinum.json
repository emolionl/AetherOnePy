    "Characteristics" : [ "The well-known symptoms which characterise an attack of measles may all be taken as guides for its homoeopathic use. Its chief use hitherto has been as a prophylactic against infection, and to clear up after effects of an attack. My own use of it has been confined to the 30th and higher, but there is no bar upon lower potencies, and those who prefer them may begin with the 6th. As a prophylactic given to those who are, or may be, exposed to infection, I prescribe a dose of the 30th twice or thrice daily. For an attack of the disease I find nothing better than Morbil. eight or ten globules in six ounces of water, a dessertspoonful every two hours.", "The effect of this is heightened by giving alternately Bell. in the same way. These two medicines will be sufficient to carry through any uncomplicated case, and in my experience do even better than Pulsatilla. As the measles poison has a great affinity for the mucous passages, the eyes, the ears and the respiratory mucous membranes, Morbil. may be used in such cases like any other homoeopathic remedy, when the symptoms correspond." ],
