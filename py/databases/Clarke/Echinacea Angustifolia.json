    "Characteristics" : [ "Echinacea angustifolia has long been prized by eclectics in low typhoid conditions, diphtheria, malignant scarlatina, carbuncles and boils, and as a remedy in snake-bites. A remarkable case of vaccinal poisoning is recorded (H. R., x. 527) in a man, cured mainly by Echin. in 20-drop doses. The symptoms were: vitality ebbed; he became so weak he could not sit up; hair fell out; an eruption of psoriasis appeared on extremities extending to body. The disease advanced rapidly; the nails fell off. Left iritis supervened, and then keratitis of the right eye. Under Kali iod., and phospho-albumen as a food, the hair ceased to fall off, but other symptoms became rapidly worse. Echin. was now given, and slowly the disease was arrested; then gradual improvement and ultimate cure ensued. The report does not mention if the sight of the left eye was recovered. Homoeopathists have generally followed the eclectics in using substantial doses. Fortunately we are now much better placed to understand Echin., thanks to an extensive proving undertaken by J. C. Fahnestock, with additional symptoms contributed by T. C. Duncan (H. R., xiv. 386). With one exception the provers were males. The first symptom noticed was a biting, tingling sensation on the tongue, lips, and fauces (compare Acon.) with a sense of fear and pain about the heart. Febrile symptoms, full head, flushed face and accelerated pulse followed. Languor was experienced by many provers, and neuralgic, sharp, darting, shifting pains. Catarrh of the digestive add respiratory tracts. Griping pains, offensive flatus and loose yellowish stool. Drowsiness was a very marked feature. The symptoms were < after eating; in evening; after physical or mental exertion; > by lying down, and by rest. In two provers there was found a diminution of red blood corpuscles after the proving. There is much chilliness (coldness of right leg), and sensitiveness to cold, < from exposure to cold air. Pains in abdomen come and go suddenly, and are > by bending double." ],
    "Relations" : [ "The closest analogue of Ech. a. is Baptisia. In snake-bites it compares with Lobelia purpurascens; in boils with Anthracin., &c. Head feels enlarged, Arg. n., Bapt., Bovist., Glon., Nux mosch., Nux v. Cases of Rhus-poisoning have been cured with Ech. a. Compare also: the vulnerary Compositae, Arnica, Calendula and Bellis." ],
