        Chi-Square Test: This test checks if the distribution of bits in the stream matches the expected distribution. A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the bit stream significantly deviates from the expected distribution, suggesting it may not be random. A high p-value suggests the bit stream is likely random.
        Entropy: Entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness of the bit stream. Higher entropy values indicate higher randomness. For a truly random bit stream, the entropy should be close to the maximum possible value for the given length.
        Autocorrelation: This test checks for patterns or correlations within the bit stream. A low autocorrelation value indicates that the bits are not correlated and are likely random. High autocorrelation suggests patterns, indicating non-randomness.
        Monte Carlo Simulation: This test uses random sampling to estimate mathematical properties. In the context of randomness tests, it might be used to estimate the value of Ï€ or other constants. If the estimated value is close to the actual value, it suggests the bit stream is random.
        Uniqueness Check: This test checks if each integer in the bit stream appears only once. If all integers are unique, it suggests randomness. If there are duplicates, it indicates non-randomness.
